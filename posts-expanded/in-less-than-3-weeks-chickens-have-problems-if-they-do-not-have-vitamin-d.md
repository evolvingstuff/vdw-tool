#### [Poultry Feed Recalled](http://union-bulletin.com/stories/2012/07/27/poultry-feed-recalled-over-missing-vitamin-d) July 2012

The supplier had failed to include vitamin D in a batch of feed

Inadequate levels of vitamin D in a bird's diet for more than two or three weeks may cause bone weakness, fractures or joint problems, and potentially death in birds not exposed to direct sunlight daily, according to a press release from the FDA.

#### Reminder: Before the 1940's all poultry had access to the sunshine.

#### Then farmers learned that by supplementing the poultry with vitamin D that they could be '<span style="color:#00F;">cooped up</span>

#### Wonder when it will be realized that  'cooped up humans also need vitamin D supplements
