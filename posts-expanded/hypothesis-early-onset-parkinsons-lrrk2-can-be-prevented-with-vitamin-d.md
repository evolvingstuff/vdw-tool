##### Trial/Experiment details

Recruit from LRRK2 people identified by 23andMe who indicated that they could be contacted (typically 80%)

Since the high doses of vitamin D are individually adjusted this cannot be a standard RCT trial.

Also, each participant must have a local doctor who will agree to oversee the trial (Dr. will be paid)

Click on plus signs in each section to see details

##### -Benefits to PD patients, even if Vitamin D does not cure the disease

Vitamin D has been shown to provide health benefits to problems associated with PD

* [Reduce pain](/tags/reduce-pain.html)

* [Reduce both falls and fractures](/tags/reduce-both-falls-and-fractures.html)

* [Reduce cognitive decline](/tags/reduce-cognitive-decline.html)

* [Improved muscle control](/posts/skeletal-muscles-helped-by-vitamin-d-review) and [#2](/posts/elderly-lower-limb-muscle-strength-improved-with-vitamin-d-supplementation-meta-analysis)

##### -Trial duration - about 1 year

Aim for definite results within one year, not the usual 5+ years of many trials

Aim to actually demonstrate turning off the LRRK2 genes  (> 10% of participants in the best group)

Have monthly blood tests initially - Vitamin D, Ca, PTH, Mg, etc. to adjust dosing to achieve target vitamin D level

Test for LRRK2 gene quarterly

##### -Initial supplemenation concepts

Probably begin with Loading dose vitamin D - 100,000 - 600,000 IU

High dose regular/active vitamin D,  20,000 - 140,000 IU

Most likely will need more than mono-therapy (all successes have used more than just high-dose Vitamin D)

- Ultraviolet light (has been more effective than vitamin D for some diseases like MS)

- Vitamin B2 - needed by about 10% of population

- Elimination of Calcium from diet

- Omega-3 - extremely good for the [brain](/posts/vitamin-d-and-omega-3-may-reduce-cortical-atrophy-with-age)

##### -My background and motivation

For most of my life I have helped people by providing information.

As an engineer the information primarily concerned electronics and computers.

Now, after retiring and having started and run the world's largest Vitamin D website, I find that I can help people by having them learn about the benefits of vitamin D.

My spending about 1,000 hours on this Parkinson's experiment should provide the best results of several other project I have in mind,

##### -If Hypothesis proves to be true

Evolve the protocols and add more LRRK2 participants

Extend the trial to people with existing LRRK2 Parkinson's disease - such as Mr. Brin's mother

Consider extending the trial to treat the other 97 % types of P PREVENT  Parkinson's Disease due to LRRK2?

If you are interested  I can assemble a team of doctors and researchers who can write-up a detailed proposal

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By the way, I will be attending the annual Vitamin D Workshop June 18-20
