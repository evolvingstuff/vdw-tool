### Regular physical activity reduces breast cancer risk irrespective of age

 **Clipped from [press release](http://www.ecco-org.eu/Global/News/EBCC9-PR/2014/03/Boniol-Regular-physical-activity-reduces-breast-cancer-risk-irrespective-of-age.aspx)** 

Glasgow, UK: Practising sport for more than an hour day reduces the risk of contracting breast cancer, and this applies to women of any age and any weight, and also unaffected by geographical location, according to research presented to the  **9th European Breast Cancer Conference (EBCC-9)** . Compared with the least active women, those with the highest level of physical activity reduced their risk of breast cancer by 12%, researchers say.

Professor Mathieu Boniol, Research Director at the International Prevention Research Institute, Lyon, France, reported to a press conference the results of a meta-analysis of 37 studies published between 1987 and 2013, representing over four million women. “These are all the studies looking at the relationship between physical exercise and breast cancer risk that have been published to date, so we are confident that the results of our analysis are robust,” he said.
