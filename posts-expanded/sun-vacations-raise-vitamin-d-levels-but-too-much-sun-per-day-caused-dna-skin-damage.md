### Sun and Ski Holidays Improve Vitamin D Status, But are Associated with High Levels of DNA Damage.

Journal of Investigative Dermatology accepted article preview online, 20 May 2014; doi:10.1038/jid.2014.223.

Skin cancer is caused by solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR), which is also essential for vitamin D production. DNA damage (thymine dimers: T-T dimers) and vitamin D (25(OH)D) synthesis are both initiated by solar ultraviolet B radiation (UVB). We aimed to investigate the simultaneous adverse and beneficial effects of solar UVB exposure in holidaymakers. Sun-seekers and skiers (n=71) were observed over 6 days with on-site monitoring, personal diaries, and recording of personal UVB exposure doses with electronic dosimeters. Urine and blood samples were analysed for T-T dimers and 25(OH)D, respectively. The volunteers had a statistically significant increase in vitamin D. There were strong associations between UVB exposure and post-holiday levels of T-T dimers and vitamin D, as well as between post-holiday T-T dimers and vitamin D. We conclude that UVB induced vitamin D synthesis is associated with considerable DNA damage in the skin. These data, on two major health predictors, provide a basis for further field studies that may result in better understanding of the risks and benefits of "real life" solar exposure. However, vitamin D status can be improved more safely through the use of vitamin D dietary supplements.
