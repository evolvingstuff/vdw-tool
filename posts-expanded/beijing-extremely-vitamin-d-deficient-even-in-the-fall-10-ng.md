#### Vitamin D status in Mainland China

Nutrition April 2013

As an essential dietary micronutrient, vitamin D plays a pivotal role in promoting calcium absorption in the intestine and maintaining a healthy skeletal system throughout life. Beyond bone health, an emerging volume of scientific studies shows that vitamin D also may provide cardiovascular, metabolic, and immunologic benefits and reduce mortality. To our knowledge, in mainland China no national surveys have been conducted to date to depict the overall vitamin D status in the population. Therefore, the purpose of this contribution was to provide the best possible evaluation of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency in China by reviewing publications that measured plasma/serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) levels in various age groups and in different areas of China from  **January 2000 to June 2012.**  From these investigations conducted throughout the country and from newborns to adults to the elderly, it has been found that  **vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency is prevalent in the Chinese population in almost all age groups and areas if individuals are not taking vitamin Dâ€“fortified products/supplements or are lacking sufficient sunshine exposure** .  

Some studies showed severe deficiency (25<span>[OH]</span>D <25 nmol/L) in Nanjing (north latitude 31) during the winter months

and in  **Beijing (north latitude 40) in the fall** . 

This unoptimistic situation represents a significant but modifiable public health risk that deserves greater attention and more efficient and timely management.
