## Interesting article on Ginger and Cancer in [Green Medical Information](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/research-ginger-selectively-kills-breast-cancer-cells%20)

### One of the supports for the article is  **<span style="color:#00F;">attached at the bottom of this page</span>** 

Appears to be nice petri dish science. 

Will be interesting to see if this applies to the human body
