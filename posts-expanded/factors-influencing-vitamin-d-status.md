The steroid hormone vitamin D is required for normal calcium and phosphorus metabolism and is thus an important contributor to musculoskeletal health. Recent data have linked low vitamin D levels to a wide range of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease and infection. Adequate levels of vitamin D are maintained through its cutaneous photosynthesis and oral ingestion. By some estimates, one billion people worldwide have vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. 

A number of factors influence the photosynthesis and bioavailability of vitamin D and contribute to risk of impaired vitamin D status. These factors include 

* variation in sun exposure due to 

   * latitude, 

   * season, 

   * time of day, 

   * atmospheric components, 

   * clothing, 

   * sunscreen use and 

   * skin pigmentation, as well as 

* age, 

* obesity and the 

* incidence of several chronic illnesses. 

This review will focus on factors that influence vitamin D status and contribute to the prevalence of low vitamin D levels.
