## Highlights from [Natural News](http://www.naturalnews.com/038713_kidney_disease_magnesium_nutrition.html) Dr. Carol Dean (Ms Magnesium)

* magnesium is required by about 1300 enzymes systems in the body, 

* Magnesium also has about 4,000 receptor sites on body proteins.

* One doctor said he couldn't understand why there was 5X more cardiovascular hospitalization and cardiovascular events in people with lowered kidney filtration rates but normal blood chemistry..Low Magnesium!!

* Use ionized magnesium testing so you know what's really going on with magnesium levels in the body. 

> Serum magnesium testing is highly inaccurate. It gives everyone a false sense of security about magnesium levels. 

> Only about 1 percent of the total body magnesium is in the serum

* people with chronic kidney disease have the highest levels of serum magnesium and in the same sample, the lowest levels of ionized magnesium

* There are only 140 labs of 5,000 in the U.S. that do the ionized magnesium test
