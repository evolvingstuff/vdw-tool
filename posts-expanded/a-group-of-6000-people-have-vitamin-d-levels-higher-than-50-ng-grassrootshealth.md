GrassrootsHealth is sponsoring the use of blood spot test kits (laboratory analysis done by ZRT Labs) for a $65.00 + $5 shipping. 

The tests are to be done twice a year by each individual along with the submission of some basic health data. 

The kits are not available as a ‘stand alone’ without health data.

You have to fill in some information on amount of vitamin D you are taking, etc

They provide a quantity price discount. I suspect all kits are shipped at the same time)

1 test - $65 + $5 shipping

2 tests - $63/test + $5 shipping 

10 test - $60/test + $5 shipping

Which, one supposes, will be included in an update to the graph shown below.

Here is a Grassroots Chart as of April 2012
