#### Skin of seniors generates [75% less Vitamin D](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2912737/)

<img src="/attachments/d3.mock.jpg" alt="image" width="600">

 **Wonder what % of the "diseases of aging" are due to low vitamin D?** 

The Blue Zone books show seniors in their 90's who are active in gardens (getting lots of vitamin D - as well as exercise, good food, etc.)

#### How does the body's ability to produce vitamin D change with age - Perplexity AI  July 2024

The body's ability to produce vitamin D decreases with age due to several physiological changes. Here are the main factors contributing to this decline:

 **Decreased Skin Production** 

*  **Reduction in 7-dehydrocholesterol** : The concentration of 7-dehydrocholesterol, the precursor to vitamin D, in the epidermis decreases significantly with age. Studies show that the levels can drop by more than 50% from age 20 to 80.

*  **Reduced Response to UV Light** : Older skin has a diminished capacity to produce previtamin D3 when exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) light. This results in a twofold decrease in the skin's ability to produce vitamin D3 in older individuals compared to younger ones.

 **Decreased Sun Exposure** 

*  **Lifestyle Factors** : Older adults, especially those who are institutionalized or housebound, tend to have less exposure to sunlight, which further reduces their ability to synthesize vitamin D.

 **Metabolic Changes** 

*  **Reduced Renal Function** : Aging is associated with a decline in kidney function, which affects the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D). This conversion is crucial for maintaining adequate vitamin D levels in the body.

*  **Intestinal Calcium Absorption** : There is a decrease in the efficiency of calcium absorption in the intestines with age, which can be exacerbated by vitamin D deficiency.

 **Increased Risk of Deficiency** 

*  **Vitamin D Resistance** : Older adults may develop a form of vitamin D resistance, where their bodies are less responsive to the vitamin D available, further complicating the maintenance of adequate levels.

*  **Higher Catabolism** : There may be an increase in the catabolism (breakdown) of vitamin D with age, which can contribute to lower levels of the vitamin in the body.

 **Quantitative Decline** 

*  **Rate of Decline** : Research indicates that there is approximately a 13% decrease in the production of vitamin D3 per decade of life. By the age of 70, the production of vitamin D3 is roughly half of what it was at age 20.

 **Supplementation and Management** 

*  **Supplementation** : Given these challenges, vitamin D supplementation is often recommended for older adults to maintain adequate levels and support bone health. Combining vitamin D with calcium supplementation can help reduce the risk of fractures and other complications associated with deficiency.

In summary, aging significantly impacts the body's ability to produce and metabolize vitamin D due to decreased skin production, reduced sun exposure, and metabolic changes. These factors collectively increase the risk of vitamin D deficiency in older adults, making supplementation an important consideration for maintaining health.
