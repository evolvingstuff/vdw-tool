### Treatment of an Intramammary Bacterial Infection with 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3

 **<span style="color:#00F;">PLOS One PDF is attached at the bottom of this page</span>**

Deficiency of serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 has been correlated with increased risk of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and influenza. A plausible reason for this association is that expression of genes encoding important antimicrobial proteins depends on concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 produced by activated immune cells at sites of infection, and that synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is dependent on the availability of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. Thus, increasing the availability of 25(OH)D3 for immune cell synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 at sites of infection has been hypothesized to aid in clearance of the infection. This report details the treatment of an acute intramammary infection with infusion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 to the site of infection. 

Ten lactating cows were infected with in one quarter of their mammary glands. 

Half of the animals were treated intramammary with 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. 

The 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 treated animal showed significantly lower bacterial counts in milk and showed reduced symptomatic affects of the mastitis. 

It is significant that treatment with 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 reduced the severity of an acute bacterial infection. 

This finding suggested a significant non-antibiotic complimentary role for 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in the treatment of infections in compartments naturally low in 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 such as the mammary gland and by extension, possibly upper respiratory tract infections.

 **Notes** 

1. Daily feed of all of the cows contained  30,000 - 40,000 IU vitamin D

> Since a cow weighs about 800 libs, the equivalent intake of vitamin D for a human would be about 8,000 IU

> Has been known for a long time that vets give far more vitamin D to animals than doctors give to people - vets are paid to keep their patients healthy

1. 40,000 IU vitamin D twice a day injected in infected mammary glands of half of the cows

> Interesting - injected at the site of the infection, not just in the blood, or consumed.

1. Would like to compare the use of vitamin D to the use of antibiotics in cows
