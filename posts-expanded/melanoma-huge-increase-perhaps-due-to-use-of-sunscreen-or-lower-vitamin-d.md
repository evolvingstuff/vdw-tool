### Melanoma — Epidemiology, Genetics and Risk Factors

 **<span style="color:#00F;">PDF 1st chapter of book is attached at the bottom of this page</span>** 

[Entire Book – free](http://www.intechopen.com/books/recent-advances-in-the-biology-therapy-and-management-of-melanoma)

* While squamous cell carcinoma of the skin has been closely associated with long term occupational exposure to the sun, risk of developing melanoma seems to be more associated with intermittent, high intensity sun exposure (MacKie and Aitchison, 1982; Lew et al., 1983)

* Various epidemiologic studies support the finding that the number of severe sunburns and total childhood sun exposure are positively associated with the development of melanoma (Holman et al., 1986; Scotto and Fears, 1987; Cust et al., 2011; Newton-Bishop et al., 2011; Volkovova et al., 2012)
