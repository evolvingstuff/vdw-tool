#### Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are associated with cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetic adults - 2013

Endocrine. 2013 Aug 28.

Department of Endocrinology, Shanghai Pudong New Area People's Hospital, No.490, South Chuanhuan Road, Shanghai, China.

Hypovitaminosis D is highly prevalent in type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study is to determine the serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> in type 2 diabetic patients with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and examine the relationship of 25(OH)D and MCI with other clinical factors. 

One hundred and sixty-five diabetic patients were enrolled in this study. 

Among whom, 95 patients were considered as MCI <span>[Montreal Cognitive Assessment score (MoCA) < 26]</span> and the other 70 as no MCI (MoCA ≥ 26). 

Subjects were assessed clinically. Diabetic patients with MCI had a 

* longer duration of DM, 

* fewer years of education, 

* elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), 

* resistant index (RI) of carotid, and 

* lower levels of 25(OH)D {<span>[17.35 (13.02-25.92) vs 28.00 (19.67-34.30)]</span> ng/ml, P < 0.001}. 

The MoCA score was positively correlated with 

* log10<span>[25(OH)D]</span>, 

* education year, and 

inversely correlated with 

* duration of DM, 

* history of hypertension, 

* intima-media thickness (IMT), 

* FBG, 

* max-RI, and 

* min-RI. 

Log10<span>[25(OH)D]</span> was positively correlated with MoCA score, and inversely correlated with IMT, in multivariate regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, and education year, 25(OH)D (β = 0.210, P = 0.003), history of hypertension (β = -0.191, P = 0.007), IMT (β = -0.194, P = 0.007), and FBG (β = -0.157, P = 0.026) independently predicted MoCA score. 

In conclusion, our results suggest that levels of serum 25(OH)D are inversely associated with the cognitive impairment in diabetic patients. 

 **Vitamin D may be a potential protective factor for cognitive impairment in patients with type 2 diabetes.**
