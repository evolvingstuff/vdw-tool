## Vitamin d and cardiovascular disease.

Circ Res. 2014 Jan 17;114(2):379-93. [doi: 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301241.](https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301241.)

Vitamin D plays a classical hormonal role in skeletal health by regulating calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Vitamin D metabolites also have physiological functions in nonskeletal tissues, where local synthesis influences regulatory pathways via paracrine and autocrine mechanisms. The active metabolite of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, binds to the vitamin D receptor that regulates numerous genes involved in fundamental processes of potential relevance to cardiovascular disease, including 

* cell proliferation and differentiation, 

* apoptosis, 

* oxidative stress, 

* membrane transport, 

* matrix homeostasis, and 

* cell adhesion. 

Vitamin D receptors have been found in all the major cardiovascular cell types including *cardiomyocytes, 

* arterial wall cells, and 

* immune cells. 

Experimental studies have established a role for vitamin D metabolites in pathways that are integral to cardiovascular function and disease, including 

* inflammation, 

* thrombosis, and the 

* renin-angiotensin system. 

Clinical studies have generally demonstrated an independent association between vitamin D deficiency and various manifestations of degenerative cardiovascular disease including vascular calcification. 

However, the role of vitamin D supplementation in the management of cardiovascular disease remains to be established. This review summarizes the clinical studies showing associations between vitamin D status and cardiovascular disease and the experimental studies that explore the mechanistic basis for these associations.
