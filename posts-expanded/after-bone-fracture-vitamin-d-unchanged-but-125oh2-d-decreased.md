Animal models suggest a key role for dihydroxylated vitamin D metabolites in fracture healing, as evidenced by increases in serum concentration of 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (24R,25<span>[OH]</span>(2) D) following long bone fracture. Human studies investigating the kinetics of serum concentrations of 24R,25<span>[OH]</span>(2) D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25<span>[OH]</span>(2) D) and their parent metabolite 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) are lacking. We therefore conducted a longitudinal study to determine whether  **total, free or bioavailable**  concentrations of these vitamin D metabolites fluctuate in humans following long bone fracture. 

Twenty-eight patients with cross-shaft (diaphyseal) long bone fracture presenting to an Emergency Department in London, UK, were studied. Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D, 24R,25(OH)(2) D, 1,25(OH)(2) D, vitamin D binding protein, albumin and calcium were determined within 48 hours of fracture, and again at one and six weeks post-fracture. Concentrations of free and bioavailable vitamin D metabolites were calculated using standard equations. 

No changes in mean serum concentrations of 25(OH)D or 24R,25(OH)(2) D were seen at either follow-up time point vs. baseline. 

By contrast, mean serum 1,25(OH)(2) D concentration  **declined by 21%**  over the course of the study, from 68.5 pmol/L at baseline to 54.1 pmol/L at 6 weeks (p < 0.05). 

This decline was associated with an increase in mean serum corrected calcium concentration, from 2.32 mmol/L at baseline to 2.40 mmol/L at one week (p < 0.001), that was maintained at 6 weeks. 

No changes in free or bioavailable concentrations of any vitamin D metabolite investigated were seen over the course of the study. 

We conclude that serum 1,25(OH)(2) D concentration declines following long bone fracture in humans, but that the serum 24R,25(OH)(2) D concentration does not fluctuate. 

The latter finding contrasts with those of animal models reporting increases in serum 24R,25(OH)(2) D concentration following long bone fracture. © 2012 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.
