Purpose: To evaluate plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D and serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC).

Methods

This observational case–control study involved 49 patients with SAC without any other ocular and systemic diseases, and 44 consecutive, age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D and serum total IgE levels of all subjects were quantified with electrochemiluminescence technique. Results were compared between the groups, and p values of <0.05 were considered as statistically significant.

Results

No significant differences were found between the groups with respect to age (p = 0.41) and sex (p = 0.98). 

Plasma vitamin D levels of the 

* subjects with SAC (*median 8.03 ng/ml, range 3.00–17.97 ng/ml) were significantly lower than the 

* control group (median 10.52 ng/ml, range 3.30–25.92 ng/ml) (p = 0.007). 

Serum total IgE levels of 

* patients with SAC (median 48.65 IU/ml, range 1.77–812.00 IU/ml) were significantly higher when compared to the 

* control group (median 32.49 IU/ml, range 0.14–104.60 IU/ml) (p = 0.003).

Conclusions

We found lower plasma vitamin D levels and higher serum total IgE levels in patients with SAC.
