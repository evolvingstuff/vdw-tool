### The Many Forms and Functions of Essential Vitamin D for Dialysis Patients

Journal of Renal Nutrition, Volume 23, Issue 4 , Pages e87-e88, July 2013

Introduction/Overview 

The screening and treatment of vitamin D deficiency is now routinely done in most dialysis clinics. Many dialysis patients have suboptimal levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and require vitamin D supplementation even in clinics located in the tropics.

Convincing patients to take a vitamin D supplement has been a challenge, however.

1 Barriers to vitamin D supplementation include confusion about different forms of vitamin D,

2 the lack of knowledge regarding the benefits of adequate vitamin D levels, resistance to an increased daily pill burden, and the potential out-of-pocket cost for “another pill.”

Many patients believe that the vitamin D analog (e.g., oral calcitriol, Hectoral, or Zemplar) they receive in the dialysis clinic is sufficient to address their low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. Their confusion is understandable on the basis of the umbrella term “vitamin D” that is commonly used to refer to the various forms of this hormone-like vitamin in the lay literature and among members of the health team. For example, medical professionals mistakenly tell patients “this is vitamin D” when they administer a vitamin D analog instead of the more accurate “this is an analog of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.”

Requesting patients to add another pill to their daily medication routine is another challenge. In the Transtheoretical Model of Change,3 knowledge of the benefit of a new behavior, or the risk of not adopting a new behavior, empowers a patient to make a behavior change. Therefore, a summary of the benefits of supplemental vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) or vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and the risks associated with low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels 4 would help patients more easily surmount their resistance to an increased pill burden and out-of-pocket costs. However, such a patient-friendly summary of the benefits and risks has not been readily available for patient education.

Thus, a 1-page handout was developed to aid in the education of dialysis patients receiving vitamin D supplementation. (VitaminDWiki was unable to find the PDF)

This patient education handout uses a schematic diagram to illustrate the relationship between the different forms and functions of vitamin D.

Providing additional information such as a list of dietary sources of vitamin D to further explain the difficulty in consuming adequate amounts through food and a list of acceptable vitamin D products available in their respective communities to this 1-page educational handout may be helpful.
