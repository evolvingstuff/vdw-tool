## Derived from [Britain's bad summer will see epidemic of vitamin deficiency: expert](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9698670/Britains-bad-summer-will-see-epidemic-of-vitamin-deficiency-expert.html) The Telegraph, Nov 2012

### Highlights for 2012

* 18 % fewer hours of sunlight hours than average of the last 30 years 

* Fewer hours of sunlight than past ten years.

* Parts of northern England recorded sunshine hours in summer similar to that of late winter.

* Already worst whooping cough for decades 

> (UK, Western Washington, Montana, etc. which have all had a cloudy 2012 summer) 

### There were so few hours of sunlight in in the UK in 2012 that many were unable to re-stock vitamin D levels

### VitaminDWiki anticipates poorer health for UK at high risk of being vitamin D deficient

* Seniors – more pneumonia, falls, 

* Pregnant – more pre-term birth, c-sections; rickets, preclampsia - specially with twins

* Dark Skin – fewer pregnacies, more problems with pregnacies

* Multiple Sclerosis– more relapses

* Obese – worse health

* Diabetics – worse health

### Health problems which show up quickly with low vitamin D include:

Flu, Respiratory Tract Infection, pneumonia

Chronic Pain – such as back pain

Menstrual pain

Rheumatoid Arthritis pain

Seasonal Affective Disorder

Longer stays in hospital after surgery (recovery, MRSA)

More deaths while in hospital

Headaches, including migraine
