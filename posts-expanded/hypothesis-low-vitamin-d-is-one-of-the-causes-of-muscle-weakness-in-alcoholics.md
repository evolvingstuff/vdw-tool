# Is Vitamin D Deficiency a Confounder in Alcoholic Skeletal Muscle Myopathy?

Alcohol Clin Exp Res. 2012 Dec 14. [doi: 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2012.01902.x.](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1530-0277.2012.01902.x.)

BACKGROUND: Excessive intake of alcohol is often associated with low or subnormal levels of vitamin D even in the absence of active liver disease. As vitamin D deficiency is a well-recognized cause of myopathy, alcoholic myopathy might be related to vitamin D deficiency. Chronic alcoholic myopathy affects approximately half of chronic alcoholics and is characterized by the insidious development of muscular weakness and wasting. Although alcohol or its metabolites may have a direct toxic effect on muscles, the relationship between alcoholic myopathy and vitamin D deficiency has not been examined extensively.

METHODS: We reviewed the literature on alcoholic myopathy and hypovitaminosis D myopathy and compared the pathophysiological findings to designate possible mechanisms of vitamin D action in alcohol-related myopathy.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Given the strong interdependency of suboptimal levels of  **vitamin D, phosphate, and magnesium**  in chronic alcohol abuse, we hypothesize that combined deficiencies interfere with membrane and intracellular metabolic processes in chronic alcohol-related myopathy; however, it is not yet possible to define exact mechanisms of interaction.
