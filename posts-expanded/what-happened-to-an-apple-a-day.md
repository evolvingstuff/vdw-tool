A person asked, What happened to "an apple a day"  as a result of reading our Dec 22 VitaminDWiki newsletter

### Apple a day was great a century ago.

 **Now the poor apple from the grocery store has** 

* far more pesticides

> many [pesticides to reduce vitamin D in the body](/tags/pesticides-to-reduce-vitamin-d-in-the-body.html)

* about 1/10 the Magnesium  - [Mg is the most important co-factor for vitamin D](/tags/mg-is-the-most-important-co-factor-for-vitamin-d.html)

> A good level of Mg increases the availability of vitamin D by about 30%

### His question referred to  an apple a day keeps the doctor away

1866 Wales "A Pembrokeshire proverb. Eat an apple on going to bed, And you'll keep the doctor from earning his bread."

It evolved to “an apple a day, no doctor to pay

then an apple a days sends the doctor away,

and since 1922  an apple a day keeps the doctor away''

 **By the way: a slice of apple pie used to have about 2,000 IU of vitamin D (due to the free-range-lard in the crust)** 

[Many reasons why vitamin D deficiency has become epidemic](/tags/many-reasons-why-vitamin-d-deficiency-has-become-epidemic.html) has 18 recent reasons why an apple is no longer enough
