### Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D predicts the short-term outcomes of Chinese patients with acute ischemic stroke.

Clin Sci (Lond). 2013 Sep 11. 

Tu Sr WJ, Zhao SJ, Xu DJ, Chen H.

Background Low vitamin D levels have been reported to contribute to the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality, especially stroke. We therefore evaluated the short-term prognostic value of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH) D]</span> in Chinese patients with an acute ischemic stroke (AIS). 

Methods From February 1, 2010 to September 30, 2012, consecutive stroke patients admitted to the emergency department at two hospitals in Beijing, China were identified. Clinical information was collected. Serum concentration of 25(OH) D and NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) were measured at the time of admission. Short-term functional outcome was measured by modified Rankin scale (mRS) 90 days after admission. Multivariate analyses were performed using logistic regression models. 

Results During the inclusion period, 231 patients were diagnosed as AIS, and 220 completed follow-up. The median serum 25(OH) D level was significantly lower in AIS patients as compared to normal controls [ **14.2**  (IQR, 10.2-18.9)ng/ml vs  **17.9**  (IQR, 12.5-22.9)ng/ml; p<0.001)](__14.2__%20(IQR,%2010.2-18.9)ng/ml%20vs%20__17.9__%20(IQR,%2012.5-22.9)ng/ml;%20p<0.001)). 

25(OH) D was an independent prognostic marker of short-term functional outcome and death <span>[__odds ratio (OR) 0.79__ (0.73-0.85) and 0.70 (0.50-0.98), respectively, p< 0.01 for both, adjusted for NHISS, other predictors and vascular risk factors]</span> in patients with AIS. In receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the prognostic accuracy of 25(OH) D was higher compared to all other serum predictors and was in the range of NIHSS score. 

Conclusion These data suggest that 25(OH) D is an independent prognostic marker for death and functional outcome within 90 days in Chinese patients with AIS even after adjusting for possible confounding factors.

Note: Chinese have very low levels of vitamin D, and those with the lowest have only 19% more of a chance of stroke
