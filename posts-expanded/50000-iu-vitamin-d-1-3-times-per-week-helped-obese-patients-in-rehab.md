### Improving protein and vitamin D status of obese patients participating in physical rehabilitation.

Baer JT.

Rehabil Nurs. 2013 May-Jun;38(3):115-9. [doi: 10.1002/rnj.100.](https://doi.org/10.1002/rnj.100.)

PURPOSE: Sarcopenia and vitamin D deficiency increase risk of disability outcomes associated with a million hip and knee replacements annually. 

The purpose of the present study was to identify protein and vitamin D inadequacy in arthroplasty patients, and observe the effect of supplementation on metabolic markers on protein and vitamin D status.

METHODS: One hundred and eighty obese arthroplasty patients admitted for inpatient rehabilitation, positive for protein and vitamin D insufficiency, received supplemental protein and vitamin D.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Following supplementation, normalization of protein and vitamin D status was achieved. 

Nutrient supplementation during physical rehabilitation provided an efficient and effective means to reverse nutrient deficiency in an obese, orthopedic population.

##### CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Inpatient physical rehabilitation is an opportune environment for nurses to provide education and intervention of nutrient supplementation, which may lessen consequences of sarcopenic obesity and related frailty disorders.
