#### Vitamin D Deficiency in Children With Cancer.

J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2013 Jul 3.

Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Richmond, Medical College of Virginia †Department of Epidemiology and Community Health, Virginia Commonwealth University ‡Medical College of Virginia §Virginia Commonwealth University Health System, Richmond, VA.

A limited number of small studies have examined the vitamin D status of pediatric oncology patients, and the results indicate an increased prevalence of hypovitaminosis. We conducted a cross-sectional study with the primary aim of describing the vitamin D status of our pediatric cancer patients and any associations with demographic characteristics. Our secondary aim was to compare this prevalence to that of a healthy population. We collected data on children seen in our clinic and determined the overall prevalence of hypovitaminosis.  **We then compared this prevalence to that of healthy populations described in the literature** . 

The prevalence of hypovitaminosis in our study population was 72%. Forty-three percent of our patients were considered deficient with 8% being severely deficient. Our analysis revealed a significant association between the outcome and age in that patients 6 years and above were more likely to have hypovitaminosis after adjustment for other characteristics ( **AOR=3.23** ; 95% CI, 1.11-9.40). When compared with a healthy pediatric population, our patients had a significantly higher prevalence of hypovitaminosis (P-value=0.003). Vitamin D deficiency is very common in children with cancer, representing a subpopulation of high-risk patients that could benefit most from early detection and supplementation.
