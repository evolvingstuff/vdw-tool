### [Can someone be allergic to caramel?](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080812214114AA4Vw9n) Yahoo Answers 2008

Caramel color is one of the most widely used colorants in foods - soft drinks as an example

It seems doubtful that you are allergic to carmel in some vitamin D supplements if you are not also allergic to soft drinks

Costco and Nature Made are examples suppliers using Carmel

Bio-Tech is one of the very few suppliers which uses NO additives
