#### ATTAINING SUFFICIENT LEVELS OF VITAMIND IN DEFICIENT NEONATES WITH TWO REGIMENS OF VITAMIN D SUPPLEMENTATION

Presented at 6th Europaediatrics Conference, June 2013, Scotland

Mehrdad Shakiba ; Ali Pahlosaye Shahid Sadoughi Hospital, Iran

Vitamin D deficiency is common in pregnancy and human milk is not adequate for delivering of vitamin D so supplementation is necessary, but how long it takes to have sufficient level of vitamin D in infants who are delivered from deficient mothers and finding an alternative way to supply it in the first month are the aims of this study.

Material& method: This trial was performed in 2010 in Iran. Eighty two full term healthy baby who were delivered from deficient mothers either received oral bolus 30,000IU vitaminD3/month(34 babies) or 400IU/day(48 babies) within two weeks of life, 25 hydroxy vitamin D was measured monthly by Chemiluminescent immunoassay and levels > 20ng/ml are accepted as sufficient.

Results: 90% of cases in bolus group reached sufficient level within one month although this achievement happened after 4 months for other group . Percentage of babies who had reached level  **>30ng/ml**  significantly differed between groups at two months of age , 90% versus 30% in bolus and routine dose respectively (p=0.003). none of cases had level >100ng/ml of 25hydroxy vitamin D.

Conclusion: one approach for babies who were deficiently born might be oral 30000IU vitamin D3 in single dose that provides a sufficient amount of vitamin for first month of life which could be followed by routine recommended dose of 400 IU/day. otherwise it takes four months to have sufficient level of vitamin D in 90% of cases by routine recommendation , this gap may have some clinical effects which need to be determined.
