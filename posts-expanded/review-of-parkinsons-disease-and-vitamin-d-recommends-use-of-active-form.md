# Vitamin D and Parkinson's disease

Journal of Neuroscience Research, 28 AUG 2012

Khanh vinh quôc Luong*, Lan Thi Hoàng Nguyên

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common form of neurodegeneration among the elderly population. 

PD is clinically characterized by 

* tremors, 

* rigidity, 

* slowness of movement, and 

* postural imbalance. 

Interestingly, a significant association has been demonstrated between PD and low levels of vitamin D in the serum, and vitamin D supplement appears to have a beneficial clinical effect on PD. 

Genetic studies have provided the opportunity to determine which proteins link vitamin D to PD pathology, e.g., 

* Nurr1 gene, 

* toll-like receptor, 

* gene related to lipid disorders, 

* vascular endothelial factor, 

* tyrosine hydroxylase, and 

* angiogenin. 

Vitamin D also exerts its effects on  **cancer**  through nongenomic factors, e.g., bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination, interleukin-10, Wnt?-catenin signaling pathways, mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, and the reduced form of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. 

In conclusion, vitamin D might have a beneficial role in PD. 

Calcitriol is best used for PD because it is the active form of the vitamin D3 metabolite and modulates inflammatory cytokine expression. 

Further investigation with calcitriol in PD is needed.

### VitaminDWiki is unsure if supplementation of Calcitriol is needed for PD.

It appears that more vitamin D would allow the body to produce more Calcitriol.

Essential fatty acids appear to also increase the production of Calcitriol
