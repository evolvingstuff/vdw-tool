## Clipped from various places on the web Dec 20, 2012

* Sir Alex Ferguson, manager of Manchester United soccer club, has revealed that United had a Vitamin D machine installed for compensate for Manchester's lack of natural sunlight. 

* Used 3X per week by each of the soccer players

* Now Manchester United can combat lack of sun

* Manchester has a reputation as being one of the wettest places in the UK, so it's little wonder Sir Alex Ferguson had a tanning booth installed so the players could top up their Vitamin D levels.

* The city has an average annual rainfall of 806.6 millimetres (31.76 inches) and 140 days of rain each year, though both are actually below the national average.
