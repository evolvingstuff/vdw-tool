#### Vitamin d fortified bread improves pain and physical function domains of quality of life in nursing home residents.

Abstract Nursing home residents have severe vitamin D deficiency and increased risk of falls and fractures. These individuals may need 125 μg of vitamin D3 to achieve desirable 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations to improve overall health. We evaluated health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in 45 nursing home residents (28 women and 17 men, aged 58-89 years) with 25(OH)D concentrations <50 nM who consumed daily one bun that had been fortified with 125 μg vitamin D3. The Romanian version of Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO-41) was applied at baseline and after 12 months. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA). 

After one year supplementation, serum 25(OH)D reached optimal status (>75 nM) and bone health has improved significantly. Nursing home residents who consumed daily bread fortified with 125 μg vitamin D3 reported significant (P=.02 for the effect of time) improvement in HRQoL (total score of QUALEFFO-41). The interaction time x treatment was also statistically significant on pain (P=.04), daily activities (P=.02), and locomotion (P=.04). To ensure the serum concentrations of 25(OH)D recommended by medical groups for bone- and general-health in the older nursing residents, the practical experience shows that much higher amounts of vitamin D3 are required. Fortification of bread and cereals is a feasible way to improve vitamin D nutrition.
