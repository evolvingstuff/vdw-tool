#### Vitamin D Status and Concomitant Autoimmunity in Celiac Disease

Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology: 16 January 2013,[doi: 10.1097/MCG.0b013e318266f81b](https://doi.org/10.1097/MCG.0b013e318266f81b)

Goals: To determine whether patients with celiac disease (CD) and low vitamin D levels also have a higher prevalence of other autoimmune diseases (AD) as compared with patients with normal vitamin D levels.

Background: Patients with CD carry a higher risk of other autoimmune disorders. Because of its immunoregulatory properties, vitamin D deficiency has been proposed in the pathogenesis of a variety of AD. Whether low vitamin D levels in patients with CD can predict concomitant AD is unknown.

Study: A retrospective cross-sectional study of 530 adult patients with CD and a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level on record at Columbia University Medical Center.

Results: One hundred thirty-three patients (25%) had vitamin D deficiency. The prevalence of AD was similar among those with normal vitamin D levels (11%), insufficiency (9%), and deficiency (12%, P=0.66). On multivariate analysis, adjusting for age of CD diagnosis and sex, vitamin D deficiency was not associated with AD ( **odds ratio, 1.35** ; 95% confidence interval, 0.62-2.95). The risk of psoriasis was higher in patients with vitamin D deficiency (7% vs. 3%, P=0.04). Vitamin D deficiency was more common in those who presented with anemia (39%) than in those who did not (23% P=0.002).

Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency in CD is common but does not predict AD. The risk of psoriasis is increased in vitamin D-deficient CD patients. Assessment of vitamin D seems to be a high-yield practice, especially in those CD patients who present with anemia.
