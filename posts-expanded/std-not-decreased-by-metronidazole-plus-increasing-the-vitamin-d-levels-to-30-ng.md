Objective

Low serum vitamin D levels have been associated with increased prevalence of the reproductive tract condition bacterial vaginosis (BV). The objective of this trial was to evaluate the effect of high-dose vitamin D supplementation on BV recurrence.

Study design

This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial enrolled 118 women with symptomatic BV from an urban STD clinic (clinicaltrials.gov registration NCT01450462). 

All participants received 500mg oral metronidazole  **twice daily for seven days.**  

Intervention participants (n=59) also received nine doses of 50,000 international units of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) over 24 weeks; control women (n=59) received matching placebo. Recurrent BV was assessed via Nugent scoring after 4, 12 and 24 weeks. We assessed the effect of the intervention using an intention-to-treat approach, fitting Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate recurrent BV over the follow-up period.

Results

Participants were primarily African-American (74%), with a median age of 26 years. Median pre-supplementation serum vitamin D (25(OH)D) was similar across randomization arms: 16.6 ng/mL in the vitamin D arm and 15.8 ng/mL in the control arm. At trial completion, median 25(OH)D among women receiving vitamin D was 30.5 ng/mL, vs. 17.8 ng/mL in control women; 16% of women receiving vitamin D and 57% receiving placebo remained vitamin D deficient (<20 ng/mL). BV recurrence was not reduced by vitamin D supplementation (intention-to-treat hazard ratio: 1.11 (95% confidence interval: 0.68, 1.81). By the 24-week visit, 65% of women randomized to vitamin D had BV, compared to 48% of control women. Median time to BV recurrence was 13.7 weeks in the vitamin D arm and 14.3 weeks in the control arm.

Conclusions

Women receiving vitamin D experienced significant increases in serum 25(OH)D, but this increase was not associated with decreased BV recurrence in this high-risk STD clinic population.

 **VitaminDWiki suspect the lack of benefit was from** 

1. May be difficult to impove immune system after metronidazole - wish they has a trial arm without metronidazole

1. Average vitamin D levels only got to 31 ng after 9 weeks

> So at even at 9 weeks half of the women had less than 31 ng

> A loading dose of vitamin D probably would have been much better.
