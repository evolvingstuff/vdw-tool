 **Summary by Claude Sonnet AI - Feb 2025** 

This image shows a comprehensive flow chart explaining how Vitamin D is processed and utilized in the human body. 

Let me break it down systematically:

* The chart starts at the top by identifying the main sources and products of Vitamin D, which come through three primary pathways:

1.  **Direct absorption through sun exposure** (UVB rays), topical application, or sublingual supplements that enter through the skin or mouth

1.  **Water-dispersible supplements** that can be inhaled through the lungs/nose or injected into muscle/abdomen

1.  **Fat-soluble sources from food**  (particularly wild fatty fish and organ meats) that enter through the gut and lymph system

* All these pathways lead to Calciferol in the blood, which is the first major checkpoint in Vitamin D processing. The chart then shows how this Calciferol can be transformed into two main metabolites:

 **First** , it becomes Calcidiol (25(OH)D), which is what doctors typically measure in blood tests. This can come from:

* Direct cell activation (not involving liver or kidneys)

* Calcidiol supplements through the gut or injection

* Liver processing

 **Second** , it can become Calcitriol (1,25(OH)₂D), which is the fully activated form. This comes from:

* Herb/pill supplements through the gut or injection

* Kidney processing

* Production by microphages and nearby cells

* The bottom of the chart shows how all these forms ultimately interact with Vitamin D receptors in cells. 

* There are also several important storage points shown, including 

   * skeletal muscle, 

   * fat tissue, and 

   * transfer pathways to breast milk and through the placenta.

* An interesting detail the chart emphasizes is that Vitamin D activation can occur through multiple pathways - not just the traditionally taught liver/kidney route, but also through direct cellular activation, which is shown in separate boxes to highlight this important point.

* The chart was created by VitaminDWiki in February 2025, and includes a shortened URL for reference.

### From the sun: takes time, no cost, probably the best way, only available part of the year

 **Get benefits of sun with minimal clothing, in the middle of day, during summer** 

 **[How many minutes of sun do I need – age, skin color, UV index – Nov 2014](/tags/how-many-minutes-of-sun-do-i-need-age-skin-color-uv-index-nov-2014.html)** 

### Maximize vitamin D for  time spent in the good sun, and minimize skin problems

[Wear less clothing](/tags/wear-less-clothing.html)

[Use a  rarely available type of sunscreen](/posts/ways-to-block-uva-but-not-the-uvb-which-makes-vitamin-d) which only blocks UVA (tanning) and not UVB (vitamin D) 

[Suntan oils effectively have a negative SPF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_tanning_lotion) should increase both tanning  and vitamin D production by about 30%

They are basically mineral oils which reduce the light scattered by the skin

### Maximize Vitamin D rate while being socially acceptable

[T-shirts, Polo-shirts, Shorts](/posts/increase-your-vitamin-d-from-the-sun-by-wearing-a-tan-through-instead-of-standard-shirt) made from patented cloth which blocks only half of the UV rays

### Can't use the sun when:

#### Concerned about skin aging, skin cancer

Never remain in the sun long enough that you burn, or even redden = skin damage

#### Elderly Skin generates much less Vitamin D

<img src="/attachments/d3.mock.jpg" alt="image" width="400">

#### When the sun is TOO hot

[It appears to be possible to make silver-coat a plexiglass “window”](/posts/vitamin-d-from-the-sun-without-the-heat-silver-coated-plexiglass) 

that only passes UVB: no UVA, visible, nor heat.  Not commercially available still as of 2024

#### When there is not enough sun - uness use reflectors to concentrate it

## From UV

### [Vitamin D lamp 1 cent per hour](/tags/vitamin-d-lamp-1-cent-per-hour.html)

### [UV better than oral for various diseases](/tags/uv-better-than-oral-for-various-diseases.html)

### [UVB added in classroom reduced cavities, increased height, increased academics. etc](/posts/uvb-added-in-classroom-reduced-cavities-increased-height-increased-academics-etc)

#### Vitamin D from the sun/UV with minimal darkening of skin

Good description of [Discrimination based on skin color](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorism) WikiPedia

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;skin bleaching was a $28 billion/year market in 2008. Many women want lighter, not darker skin

UVB (vitamin D) without UVA (tanning) – Note: [virtually all tanning equipment has a LOT of UVA](/tags/virtually-all-tanning-equipment-has-a-lot-of-uva.html)

[Special Window – passes only UVB, not tanning rays](/posts/vitamin-d-from-the-sun-without-the-heat-silver-coated-plexiglass)

### If poorly functioning Liver

## Inhaled (if poor gut, liver, or perhaps lung problems)

[VitaminDWiki started investigating late 2016](/tags/vitamindwiki-started-investigating-late-2016.html)

The lungs have been proven to convert Vitamin D into Calcidiol locally

The 90 square meters of lung surface area may prove to be an excellent way to get vitamin D into the body

Inhaled vitamin D may reduce breathing problems: many tissues can directly activate Vitamin D (no liver nor kidney needed)

## Calcidiol

 **Calcidiol = Calcifediol = 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 = 25(OH)D = semi-activated Vitamin D** 

[About a 6X increase in effective vitamin D in meat was reported in March 2014](/posts/vitamin-d-from-animal-increases-6x-when-consider-that-already-processed-by-animal-livers)

[Mussels may have an equivalent of 2,000 IU of Vitamin D per 100 grams – Dec 2016](/tags/mussels-may-have-an-equivalent-of-2000-iu-of-vitamin-d-per-100-grams-dec-2016.html) example shellfish

[Poorly functioning livers do not process vitamin D (Calcidiol is needed) – Sept 2014](/tags/poorly-functioning-livers-do-not-process-vitamin-d-calcidiol-is-needed-sept-2014.html)

[Vitamin D3 becomes Calcidiol which becomes Calcitriol](/tags/vitamin-d3-becomes-calcidiol-which-becomes-calcitriol.html)

[Calcidiol may be 5X more effective than Vitamin D3 – June 2012](/tags/calcidiol-may-be-5x-more-effective-than-vitamin-d3-june-2012.html)

[Is HyD (25(OH)D) a better form of vitamin D for some animals and maybe humans with liver problems](/posts/is-hyd-25ohd-a-better-form-of-vitamin-d-for-some-animals-and-maybe-humans-with-liver-problems)

[Fully-activated Vitamin D (Calcitriol) is produced inside and outside of the kidneys – July 2020](/tags/fully-activated-vitamin-d-calcitriol-is-produced-inside-and-outside-of-the-kidneys-july-2020.html)

&nbsp; &nbsp; Lungs, Colon, Skin, Intestines, Bone, Brain, Eyes, Prostate, Mitocondria, etc.

Note: Calcidiol does not appear to get into breast milk

Note: Calcidiol may not be stored in fat - which is a consideration for people who are obese
