Serotonin and vitamin D have been proposed to play a role in autism; however, no causal mechanism has been established. 

Here, we present evidence that vitamin D hormone (calcitriol) activates the transcription of the serotonin-synthesizing gene tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) in the brain at a vitamin D response element (VDRE) and represses the transcription of TPH1 in tissues outside the blood-brain barrier at a distinct VDRE. 

The proposed mechanism explains 4 major characteristics associated with autism: 

* the low concentrations of serotonin in the brain and its elevated concentrations in tissues outside the blood-brain barrier; 

* the low concentrations of the vitamin D hormone precursor 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D3]</span>; 

* the high male prevalence of autism; and 

* the presence of maternal antibodies against fetal brain tissue. 

Two peptide hormones,  **oxytocin and vasopressin** , are also associated with autism and genes encoding the oxytocin-neurophysin I preproprotein, the oxytocin receptor, and the arginine vasopressin receptor  **contain VDREs for activation** . 

Supplementation with  **vitamin D and tryptophan**  is a practical and affordable solution to help prevent autism and possibly ameliorate some symptoms of the disorder.
