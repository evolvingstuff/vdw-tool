## Population groups in dietary transition.

Food Nutr Res. 2013 Oct 3;57. [doi: 10.3402/fnr.v57i0.21668.](https://doi.org/10.3402/fnr.v57i0.21668.)

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the effects of dietary acculturation in minority groups in the Nordic countries, including immigrants from non-Western societies.

METHODS: A search was performed in Medlin33e/PubMed and SweMed+ for articles published in 1990-2011.

RESULTS: A total of  **840 articles were identified** , with a final 32 articles used to tabulate results which were included in the primary analysis. 

High rates of vitamin D  **deficiency (23 articles)**  were found in immigrants of non-Western origin; deficiency rates were very high among both pregnant and non-pregnant women, and also among children, with young children of immigrant parents showing  **50 times higher risk for rickets**  when compared to children of indigenous parents. 

The risk of  **iron deficiency**  (two articles) was high among immigrant women, while the results were inconclusive regarding children. 

High rates of  **dental caries**  (seven articles) were found among pre-school and younger school children of immigrant origin, while the risk of caries was not as evident among older children. 

In a secondary analysis, including 48 articles (results not tabulated), overweight and obesity (14 articles) were seen in many immigrant groups, 

resulting in a 

* high prevalence of diabetes (2 review articles from a total of 14 original articles) and 

* incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD; seven articles). 

For hypertension (three articles), dyslipidemia (four articles), and dietary patterns among immigrants (10 articles), the results were contradictory.

CONCLUSIONS: Risk of vitamin D deficiency is alarmingly high in the Nordic countries among immigrants of non-Western origin, especially among women. Dental caries is high among immigrant children aged 0-7 years due to a higher intake of sugary products. Overweight and obesity, associated with a higher risk of diabetes and CHD, are prevalent in many immigrant groups and need further attention.

KEYWORDS: Ethnic groups, cardiovascular diseases, dental caries, diabetes, obesity, vitamin D deficiency
