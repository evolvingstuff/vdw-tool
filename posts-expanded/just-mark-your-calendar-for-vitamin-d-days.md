Could be once a week, once every few days, or even once every two weeks. 

(Studies found no difference in disease prevention for vitamin D being taken daily or monthly) 

## Example: say you wanted to average 4,000 IU/day.

Could just take a 50,000 IU dose every 12 days - rounded up to being 2 weeks to make it easy to mark on the calendar

When you have taken the supplement, just strike a line thru the  **D**  or the dot

## Note from Henry Lahore - admin of VitaminDWiki

I had struggled with remembering to take supplements for decades – and still have not gotten into the habit. 

I had always failed to remember to take supplements on a daily basis. 

I now take a 50,000 IU dose every 5 days (10,000 IU/day average)

## Here is what D days might look like on a variety of monthly calendars

### Similarly: could mark  **<span style="color:#F00;">D</span>**  days on paper calendars which are daily, weekly or annual; as well as electronic calendars
