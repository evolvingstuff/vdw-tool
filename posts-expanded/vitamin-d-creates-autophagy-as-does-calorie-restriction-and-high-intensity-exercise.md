#### [An alternative to vitamin D supplements?](http://gettingstronger.org/2013/02/an-alternative-to-vitamin-d-supplements/#more-4125%20) Getting Stronger Feb 2013

Author considers Vitamin D supplements to be like hormone supplements –in that there could be a danger in taking too much, since the body only limits internally generated hormones.

Author cites three recent studies which indicate that one of the key functions of the vitamin D receptor is to regulate autophagy.

Author fails to notice that the body does NOT accumulate hormone d.  

No matter what the source of hormone d, it decays away in a half life which ranges from a week to 2 months, depending on the level of hormone D in the body.

Yes, there is a concern about having too much vitamin/hormone D in the body, especially for years.  

The question is, how much is too much.
