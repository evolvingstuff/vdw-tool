Objectives: To assess the association of established multiple sclerosis (MS) risk variants in 3,254 African Americans (1,162 cases and 2,092 controls).

Methods:  **Human leukocyte antigen**  (HLA)-DRB1, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-A alleles were typed by molecular techniques. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was conducted for 76 MS-associated SNPs and 52 ancestry informative marker SNPs selected throughout the genome. Self-declared ancestry was refined by principal component analysis of the ancestry informative marker SNPs. An ancestry-adjusted multivariate model was applied to assess genetic associations.

Results: The following major histocompatibility complex risk alleles were replicated: 

* HLA-DRB1*15:01 (odds ratio <span>[OR]</span> = 2.02 <span>[95% confidence interval: 1.54–2.63]</span>, p = 2.50e-07), 

* HLA-DRB1*03:01 (OR = 1.58 <span>[1.29–1.94]</span>, p = 1.11e-05), as well as 

* HLA-DRB1*04:05 (OR = 2.35 <span>[1.26–4.37]</span>, p = 0.007) 

* and the African-specific risk allele of HLA-DRB1*15:03 (OR = 1.26 <span>[1.05–1.51]</span>, p = 0.012). 

The protective association of HLA-A*02:01 was confirmed (OR = 0.72 <span>[0.55–0.93]</span>, p = 0.013). None of the HLA-DQB1 alleles were associated with MS. Using a significance threshold of p < 0.01, outside the major histocompatibility complex region, 8 MS SNPs were also found to be associated with MS in African Americans.

Conclusion: MS genetic risk in African Americans only partially overlaps with that of Europeans and could explain the difference of MS prevalence between populations.
