#### Large, Single-Dose, Oral Vitamin D Supplementation in Adult Populations: A Systematic Review.

Endocr Pract. 2013 Nov 18:1-36.

Objective: Daily supplementation is often inadequate in treating vitamin D deficiency due to poor compliance. A single, large dose of vitamin D given at timed intervals may be an alternative strategy.Methods: We identified 2243 articles in PUBMED using the terms "high dose vitamin D," "single dose vitamin D," "bolus vitamin D," or "annual dose vitamin D." Review articles, cross-sectional studies, non-human studies, responses to other articles, and non-English articles were excluded. 

Manuscripts were also excluded if the study: 

* (1) did not use oral cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol, 

* (2) used vitamin D analogs, 

* (3) enrolled participants under age 18, 

* (4) administered doses <100,000 IU (2.5 mg), or 

* (5) administered >1 dose per year. 

References of eligible manuscripts and the Cochrane databases were also searched. 

Two independent reviewers identified eligible manuscripts, and a third reviewer evaluated disagreements. 

Thirty manuscripts were selected using these criteria.

Results: Large, single doses of vitamin D consistently increased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations in several vitamin D sufficient and deficient populations. Vitamin D3 doses of 300,000 IU or greater provided optimal changes in serum 25(OH)D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations. Vitamin D supplementation also impacted bone health and extra-skeletal endpoints.

Conclusions: This review recommends vitamin D3 be used for supplementation  **over vitamin D2** , and that single vitamin D3 doses of 300,000 IU and greater are most effective at improving vitamin D status and suppressing PTH concentrations for up to 3 months. Lower doses, however, may be sufficient in certain populations. Vitamin D doses >500,000 IU should be used judiciously in order to minimize adverse events.
