Increasing evidence has suggested an association between blood vitamin D levels and metabolic syndrome.

Objective: Our objective was to determine the relationship between blood vitamin D status and metabolic syndrome in the general adult population, using a dose-response meta-analysis.

Data Source:We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases through July 2013 to identify relevant studies.

Study Selection:Observational studies, reporting risk ratios with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for metabolic syndrome in ≥3 categories of blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels, were selected.

Data Extraction:Data extraction was performed independently by 2 authors, and the quality of the studies was evaluated using the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized Studies.

Data Synthesis:The pooled odds ratio of metabolic syndrome per 25 nmol/l increment in the serum/plasma 25(OH)D concentration was  **0.87**  (95% CI = 0.83–0.92, I2 = 85%), based on 16 “cross-sectional studies” and 1.00 (95% CI = 0.98–1.02, I2= 0%) for 2 “cohort and nested case-control studies”. The dose-response meta-analysis showed a generally linear, inverse relationship between 25(OH)D levels and metabolic syndrome in the cross-sectional studies (P for linear trend <0.001).

Conclusions:Blood vitamin D levels were associated with a risk of metabolic syndrome in cross-sectional studies but not in longitudinal studies. Randomized, clinical trials will be necessary to address the issue of causality and to determine whether vitamin D supplementation is effective for the prevention of metabolic syndrome.
