Unaware of any studies of meg-doses of vitamin D

#### There have been several indications that getting lots of vitamin D (> 20,000 IU daily) can cure some diseases

1. [Appears that Vitamin D can induce remission in recent Multiple Sclerosis](/posts/appears-that-vitamin-d-can-induce-remission-in-recent-multiple-sclerosis) 1,000 patients 20,000 IU to 140,000 IU daily

1. [Dr. Cannell on Autism – Spring 2013](/posts/dr-cannell-on-autism-spring-2013) 3 moms accidentally gave 60,000 IU daily - rapid recovery from Autism

1. [ovarian cancer had metastasized, give only months to live, internal bleeding](http://pandemicsurvivor.com/2009/06/28/a-tale-of-two-women/) 50,000 IU daily for 3 months

> Totally cured, then dropped back to 50,000 IU weekly.

1. [Traumatic Brain Injury reduced 2X by about 20,000 IU of vitamin D daily for 5 days](/tags/traumatic-brain-injury-reduced-2x-by-about-20000-iu-of-vitamin-d-daily-for-5-days.html)

> with progestrone. Similar to a loading dose

1. [Vitamin D repaired nerve in rat (50,000 IU daily dose equivalent for human) – June 2013](/posts/vitamin-d-repaired-nerve-in-rat-50000-iu-daily-dose-equivalent-for-human) 35,000 IU for average weight adult

Will be adding information to this page as I come across it.
