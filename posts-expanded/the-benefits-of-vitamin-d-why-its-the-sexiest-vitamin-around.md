## Have you been getting enough D?

### Among other things, Vitamin D impacts your sex hormones and your mood, which, if you’re like most people, you definitely want working as well as possible!

### Vitamin D is so important, it’s one of my top six biohacks.

 **Middle** 

So don’t feel like you have to be an equatorial nudist to get adequate vitamin D, 

but do make sure you take a vitamin D supplement ( **1,000 IU daily for every 25 pounds of total body weight).** 

And even though “adequate” vitamin D levels are around 30 ng/mL, aim for around 50-60, because that’s where you get your best benefits. 

 **About Dave Asprey** 

Dave Asprey, founder of  **[The Bulletproof Executive](http://www.bulletproofexec.com/)** , is a Silicon Valley investor and technology entrepreneur who spent 15 years and over $300,000 to hack his own biology. Dave lost 100 pounds without counting calories or excessive exercise, used techniques to upgrade his brain by more than 20 IQ points, and lowered his biological age while learning to sleep more efficiently in less time. Learning to do these seemingly impossible things transformed him into a better entrepreneur, a better husband, and a better father.
