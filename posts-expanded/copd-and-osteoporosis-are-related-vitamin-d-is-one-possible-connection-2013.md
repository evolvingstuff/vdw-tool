COPD is, in addition to progressive airflow obstruction, characterised by extrapulmonary manifestations that contribute to the disease severity in individual patients. Osteoporosis is recognised as one such extrapulmonary manifestation, since the prevalence of osteoporosis is higher in COPD patients than in control subjects matched for age and sex. Osteoporosis is a skeletal disease characterised by low bone mineral density or micro-architectural deterioration, resulting in increased risk of fracture. The high prevalence of osteoporosis in COPD is probably due to common risk factors such as advanced age and smoking, and to COPD-specific risk factors such as systemic inflammation and the use of corticosteroids. Interventions against common risk factors, like smoking cessation, exercise and healthy diet, might reduce the risk of fracture in patients with osteoporosis. In addition to these lifestyle guidelines, pharmacological treatment with calcium and **vitamin D**  supplementation and antiresorptive treatment (e.g. bisphosphonates) have been indicated to prevent fractures in patients with osteoporosis.
