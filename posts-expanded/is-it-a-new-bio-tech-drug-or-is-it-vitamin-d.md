### [Vitamin D Jeffrey Dach MD](http://jeffreydachmd.com/2014/06/vitamin-d-deficiency-ignored-epidemic/)

 **First portion the great article** 

What if I told you I discovered a Bio-Tech company with a new drug that could reduce the number of cancer deaths in the US by 43,000 annually, reduce colon cancer by 50%, and breast and ovarian cancer by 30%. Would you be impressed? What if I then told you this same drug could safely prevent or alleviate the following medical conditions: 

* Osteoporosis, 

* Hypertension, 

* Cardiovascular disease, 

* Cancer, 

* Depression, 

* Epilepsy, 

* Type One Diabetes,

* Insulin resistance, 

* Autoimmune Diseases, 

* Migraine Headache, 

* Polycystic Ovary Disease (PCOS), 

* Musculoskeletal and bone pain, 

* Psoriasis, and 

* Rheumatoid Arthritis, 

* Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Cohn’s), 

* chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), as well as 

* improve calcium absorption and

* reduce hip fractures.

Would you then be even more impressed, and rush out to buy the company stock and get rich quick? Of course you would, but we don’t need a new Bio-Tech drug to do this, because, all of the above benefits can be obtained with Vitamin D, an inexpensive vitamin which is free with sun exposure.
