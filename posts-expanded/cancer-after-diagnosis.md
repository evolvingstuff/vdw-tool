#### 40% less Cancer recurrence after Breast Cancer surgery if NO radiation treatment - Dec 2023

 **[Compelling case for skipping RT in some early breast cancers - MD  Edge](https://www.mdedge.com/hematology-oncology/article/266920/breast-cancer/compelling-case-skipping-rt-some-early-breast?ecd=WNL_EVE_231207_mdedge)** 

* Recurrence rate: 1% in 5 years if no radiation therapy vs 1.7% if radiation therapy

* "Omitting radiation therapy led to better health-related quality of life and functional and cosmetic outcomes, and the women viewed not having radiation as highly acceptable and appropriate treatment, not undertreatment."

* Based on a study in Lancet: Postoperative radiotherapy omission in selected patients with early breast cancer following preoperative breast MRI (PROSPECT): primary results of a prospective two-arm study, [which is behind a paywall](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(23)02476-5)

* VitaminDWiki suspects that the radiation wounds the immune system, making it less likely to be able to fight off future cancers.  Wonder if radiation decreases vitamin D levels on a long-term basis?
