Several organizations issued recommendations on desirable serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels and doses of vitamin D needed to achieve them. 

Trials allowing the formulation of evidence-based recommendations in adolescents are scarce.

We investigated the ability of two doses of vitamin D3 in achieving recommended vitamin D levels in this age group.

Post-hoc analyses on data from a one year double-blind trial that randomized 336 Lebanese adolescents, age 13 ± 2 years, to placebo, vitamin D3 at 200 IU/day (low dose), or 2,000IU/day (high dose). Serum 25(OH)D level and proportions of children achieving levels ≥ 20 ng/ml and 30 ng/ml were determined. 

 **At baseline** , mean 25(OH)D was 15 ± 7 ng/ml, 

* 16.4 ± 7 ng/ml in boys and 

* 14 ± 8 ng/ml in girls, p = 0.003; 

with a level ≥ 20 ng/ml in 18% and ≥30 ng/ml in 5% of subjects. 

At one year, mean levels were 18.6 ± 6.6 ng/ml in the low dose group, 17.1 ± 6 ng/ml in girls and 20.2 ± 7 ng/ml in boys, p = 0.01; and  **36.3 ± 22.3ng/ml in the high dose group, with no gender differences** . 25(OH)D increased to ≥ 20 ng/ml in 34% of children in the low dose and 96% in the high dose group, being higher in boys in the low dose arm only; it remained ≥30 ng/ml in 4% of children in the low dose arm but increased to 64% in the high dose arm. Baseline 25(OH)D level, BMI, and vitamin D dose assigned were the most significant predictors for reaching a 25(OH)D level ≥20 ng/ml and 30 ng/ml.

 **A daily dose of 2,000IU raised 25(OH)D level ≥20 ng/ml in 96% of adolescents (98% boys vs. 93% girls).**  

Dose response studies are needed to determine in a definitive manner the daily allowance of vitamin D for Middle Eastern adolescents with a similar profile.
