### [Nice Overview](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/2014/06/16/map-monday-50-shades-of-air-pollution/) Scientific American June 2014

* WHO concluded once-and-for-all that diesel exhausts do in fact cause cancer;

* MIT’s Laboratory for Aviation and the Environment found that about 200,000 Americans die a premature death each year due to air pollution, with road transport being the most significant with 53,000 premature deaths;

* A recent report from the OECD found that outdoor air pollution kills more than 3.5 million people per year, worldwide, and about half of that is attributable to road transport.
