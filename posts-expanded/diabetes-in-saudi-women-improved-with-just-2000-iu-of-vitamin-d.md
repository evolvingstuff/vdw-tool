#### Vitamin D supplementation as an adjuvant therapy for patients with T2DM: an 18-month prospective interventional study

Cardiovascular Diabetology 2012, 11:85 doi:10.1186/1475-2840-11-85; Published: 18 July 2012

Background

Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with impaired human insulin action, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM). In this prospective interventional study we investigated the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on the metabolic profiles of Saudi T2DM subjects pre- and post-vitamin D supplementation over an 18-month period.

Methods

T2DM Saudi subjects (men, N=34: Age: 56.6 +/- 8.7 yr, BMI, 29.1 +/- 3.3kg/m2; women, N=58: Age: 51.2 +/- 10.6 yr, BMI 34.3 +/- 4.9 kg/m2;) were recruited and given 2000 IU vitamin D3 daily for 18 months. Anthropometrics and fasting blood were collected (0, 6, 12, 18 months) to monitor serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D using specific ELISA, and to determine metabolic profiles by standard methods.

Results

In all subjects there was a significant increase in mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels from baseline (32.2+/-1.5nmol/L) to 18 months (54.7+/-1.5nmol/L; p<0.001), as well as serum calcium (baseline=2.3+/-0.23mmol/L vs. 18 months=2.6+/-0.1mmol/L; p=0.003). 

A significant decrease in 

* LDL- (baseline=4.4+/-0.8mmol/L vs. 18 months=3.6+/-0.8mmol/L, p<0.001] and 

* total cholesterol (baseline=5.4+/-0.2mmol/L vs. 18 months=4.9+/-0.3mmol/L, p<0.001) 

were noted, as well as a significant improvement in HOMA-beta function (p=0.002). 

Majority of the improvements elicited were more prominent in women than men.

Conclusion

In the Saudi T2DM population receiving oral Vitamin D3 supplementation (2000 IU/day), circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels remained below normal 18 months after the onset of treatment. 

Yet, this "suboptimal" supplementation significantly improved lipid profile with a favorable change in HDL/LDL ratio, and  **HOMA-beta function** , which were more pronounced in T2DM females.

## Notes

1. Women in the Middle East have extremely low levels of vitamin D (clothing)

> so it is understandable that women would get the benefit of vitamin D before then men

1. PDF shows good improvements in insulin levels, which are not mentioned in the abstract
