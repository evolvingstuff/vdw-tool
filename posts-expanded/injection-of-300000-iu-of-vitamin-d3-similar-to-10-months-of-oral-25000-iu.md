#### Different strategies of 25OH vitamin D supplementation in HIV+ subjects.

Int J STD AIDS. 2014 Jan 27.

Background High incidence of 25OH vitamin D deficiency has been observed in HIV-infected subjects.

Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of cholecalciferol administration on serum 25OH vitamin D levels in HIV-infected patients.

Methods This prospective cohort study included 153 HIV + subjects; 47 were treated with 300,000 IU intramuscular cholecalciferol, 67 with 25,000 IU oral cholecalciferol monthly, while the remaining 39 did not receive any treatment.

Results The group treated 

*  **orally**  had an increase of serum 25OH vitamin D concentration, changing from 15.7 ± 12.2 ng/mL to 27.4 ± 11.6 ng/mL after 10 months (T10). 

The group treated with 

*  **intramuscular supplementation**  had an improvement, changing from 18.5 ± 10.5 ng/mL to 32.9.0 ± 12.2 ng/mL at T10. 

One-way repeated measures analysis of variance indicated a significant difference for 25OH vitamin D variation (p = 0.002) among the three groups. 

A significant effect of time (p < 0.001) and group × time interaction (p < 0.001) was found; at T10, 25OH vitamin D values were significantly higher in the oral and intramuscular groups with respect to the control group.

Conclusions Our findings showed that the supplementation with cholecalciferol in patients with HIV-infection improved 25OH vitamin D serum levels, and suggest that the two types of administration are equivalent, but are insufficient to severe forms of hypovitaminosis.
