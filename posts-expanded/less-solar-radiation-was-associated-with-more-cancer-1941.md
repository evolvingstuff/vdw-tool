#### The 1941 paper on Solar Radiation and Cancer references a 1912 paper on the same subject

 **The Relation of Solar Radiation to Cancer Mortality in North America** 

Frank L. Apperly, M.D.

(From the Department of Pathology, Medical College o [ Virginia, Richmond, Virginia)

(Received for publication December 20, 1940 )

* Lots of people were on the farm

* There was no air conditioning, TV, video games, internet to keep you indoors. even if you lived in cities

 **Here are a few of the images** 

#### Cancer vs percent of agriculture in the state

 **lots of the population was on the farm back then**

#### Cancer and latitude

 **Note: the data is not sorted by latitude**

##### However, Skin Cancer increased with solar radiation
