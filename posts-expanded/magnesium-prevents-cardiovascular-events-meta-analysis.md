## Magnesium and the risk of cardiovascular events: a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.

PLoS One. 2013;8(3):e57720. [doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0057720.](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0057720.) Epub 2013 Mar 8.

BACKGROUND: Prospective studies that have examined the association between dietary magnesium intake and serum magnesium concentrations and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events have reported conflicting findings. We undertook a meta-analysis to evaluate the association between dietary magnesium intake and serum magnesium concentrations and the risk of total CVD events.

METHODOLOGY PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed systematic searches on MEDLINE, EMBASE, and OVID up to February 1, 2012 without limits. Categorical, linear, and nonlinear, dose-response, heterogeneity, publication bias, subgroup, and meta-regression analysis were performed. The analysis included  **532,979 participants from 19 studies** 

* (11 studies on dietary magnesium intake, 

* 6 studies on serum magnesium concentrations, and 

* 2 studies on both) with  **19,926 CVD events** . 

The pooled relative risks of total CVD events for the highest vs. lowest category of dietary magnesium intake and serum magnesium concentrations were 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.78 to 0.92) and 0.77 (0.66 to 0.87), respectively. In linear dose-response analysis, only serum magnesium concentrations ranging from 1.44 to 1.8 mEq/L were significantly associated with total CVD events risk (0.91, 0.85 to 0.97) per 0.1 mEq/L (Pnonlinearity = 0.465). However, significant inverse associations emerged in nonlinear models for dietary magnesium intake (Pnonlinearity = 0.024). 

The greatest risk reduction occurred when intake increased from 150 to  **400 mg/d** . There was no evidence of publication bias.

CONCLUSIONS SIGNIFICANCE: There is a statistically significant nonlinear inverse association between dietary magnesium intake and total CVD events risk. 

Serum magnesium concentrations are linearly and inversely associated with the risk of total CVD events.

### Mg intake studies

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/mg-intake-studies.jpg" alt="image">

 **How to read these kind of charts, by VitaminDWiki** 

The data to the left  of these charts indcates the studies which found that more Mg resulted in less cardiovascular problems

The size of the square indicates the number of participants in the study

The lines to the right and left of a square indicates the range of results that the study found, whereas the square indicates the average

The studies in the chart above do NOT indicate the amount of Magnesium taken - A study could have used 150 mg or 450 mg - there is no indication in the upper chart

The studies in the chart below are better. The data represent when there was more Magnesium  in the blood stream. (still does not say how much more Magnesium)

It would have been better to measure the amount of Magnesium in the cells, but such tests are expensive and so are rarely made.

## I take Magnesium and Vitamin D and Omega-3, etc

Many studies have shown that 

* Magnesium, Vitamin D, Omega-3 etc taken singlely improve health in many many ways.

* Magnesium and Vitamin D help each other.

* Omega-3 helps Vitamin D (perhaps the other way as well)

* The more vitamin D you get, the better your health.

* The more Magnesium you get, the better your health.- by the way, Magnesium is the most important [cofactor for vitamin D](/tags/cofactor-for-vitamin-d.html)

* Pico Magnesium does not cause intestinal difficulties (only one Pico study that I am aware of)

* The more Omega-3  you get, the better your health.

I hope to see some study in the future which goes beyond monotherapy and considers 2 or more items concurrently.

I am not waiting for that study to be made, I am taking all three.
