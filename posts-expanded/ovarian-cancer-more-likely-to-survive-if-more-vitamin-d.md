Objectives

The aim of this study was to examine vitamin 25(OH)D3 concentration in ovarian cancer patients in relation to a pathological subtype of the tumor, FIGO stage, grading, menopause status and overall 5-year survival.

Design and Methods: 72 epithelial ovarian cancer patients aged 37 – 79, who undergone optimal cytoreductive surgery were enrolled to the study group. Serum 25(OH)D3 concentration was measured using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay before surgery. Serum concentration of 25(OH)D3 was also measured in a group of 65 healthy non-obese women aged 35–65 years.

Results: In patients with ovarian cancer serum concentration of 25(OH)D3 was lower than in the reference group (12.5 +/? 7.75 ng/mL vs 22.4 +/? 6.5 ng/mL). No significant correlation was found between serum 25(OH)D3 concentration and histological subtype, grading, FIGO stage and menopausal status. The study group was divided into two subgroups and the survival curves were analyzed. Overall 5-years survival rate was significantly higher in the subgroup of patients with 25(OH)D3 concentration over 10 ng/mL comparing to women with concentration below 10 ng/mL.

Conclusions: Low 25(OH)D3 concentration associated with lower overall survival rate might suggest for the important role of severe deficiency in more aggressive course of ovarian cancer. Testing for 25(OH)D in the standard procedure could help to find ovarian cancer patients with worse prognosis, who would benefit of special attention and supplementation.

## Survival rates for > or < 15 ng of vitamin D

### Highlights

* Concentration of 25(OH)D3 in ovarian cancer patients was very close to deficiency. 

* 25(OH)D3 did not correlate with histological subtype, grading, FIGO stage, menopause. 

* Overall 5-years survival was lower in cancer cases with severe 25(OH)D3 deficiency.
