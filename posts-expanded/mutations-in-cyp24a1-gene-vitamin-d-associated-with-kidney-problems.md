BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Elevated serum vitamin D with hypercalciuria can result in nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis. This study evaluated the cause of excess 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1α,25(OH)(2)D(3)) in the development of those disorders in two individuals.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Two patients with elevated vitamin D levels and nephrocalcinosis or nephrolithiasis were investigated at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center and the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program, by measuring calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D metabolites, and by performing CYP24A1 mutation analysis.

RESULTS: Both patients exhibited hypercalciuria, hypercalcemia, low parathyroid hormone, elevated vitamin D (1α,25(OH)(2)D(3)), normal 25-OHD(3), decreased 24,25(OH)(2)D, and undetectable activity of 1,25(OH)(2)D-24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1), the  **enzyme that inactivates 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3)** . Both patients had bi-allelic mutations in CYP24A1 leading to loss of function of this enzyme. On the basis of dbSNP data, the  **frequency of predicted deleterious bi-allelic CYP24A1 variants in the general population is estimated to be as high as 4%-20%.** 

CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that 1,25(OH)(2)D-24-hydroxylase deficiency due to bi-allelic mutations in CYP24A1 causes elevated serum vitamin D, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and renal stones.
