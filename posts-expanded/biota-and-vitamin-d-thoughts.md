**Possible interactions between biota (gut bacteria, etc), antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics and vitamin D** 

 **Knowns:** 

1. There are some 10,000 biota in the human gut

1. Antibiotics kills off gut biota. - sometimes being a species genocide (totally losing some contingency genes)

1. Current probiotics will restock, at least for a few weeks 1-10 species.

1. Antibiotics early in life (while still developing) can have profound effects on the individual's development, even if the species is later restocked.

 **Wonder: Raise vitamin D level BEFORE antibiotics** 

Might some antibiotics kill biota less - over all, or perhaps to just some species

Might some antibiotics kill biota MORE - Just as some Chemo drugs increase potency by 3X when have high level of vitamin D

Web research to be done: Does the effectiveness of antibiotics vary with vitamin D levels, season, skin color?

 **Wonder: Raise vitamin D level AFTER antibiotics** 

Might the biota recover more quickly

Might the vitamin D reduce the risks of various diseases which antibiotics had previousl increased (this appears to be the case for 20+ diseases)

 **Wonder: Would higher Vitamin D levels help PRObiotics** 

 **Wonder: Would higher Vitamin D levels help PREbiotics** 

Many things to learn in the next few months and years.
