Data were pooled from four randomized clinical trials with vitamin D performed in Troms0 with weight reduction, insulin sensitivity, bone density, and depression scores as endpoints. Serum lipids,  **glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)** , and high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein, (HS-CRP) were measured at baseline and after 6-12 months of supplementation with vitamin D 20 000IU-40 000IU per week versus placebo. A total of 928 subjects who completed the interventions were included. At baseline the mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level in those given vitamin D was 55.9 (20.9) nmol/L and the mean increase was 82.4 (40.1) nmol/L. Compared with the placebo group there was in the vitamin D group at the end of the studies a slight, but significant,  **increase in HbA1c of 0.04%** , an increase in HS-CRP of 0.07 mg/L in those with serum 25(OH)D < 50 nmol/L, and in those with low baseline HDL-C and serum 25(OH)D < 50 nmol/L a slight decrease serum HDL-C of 0.08 mmol/L (P < 0.05). No serious side-effects were seen. 

In conclusion, in subjects without vitamin D deficiency, there is no improvement in serum lipids, HbA1c,or HS-CRP with high dose vitamin D supplementation. If anything, the effect is negative.

### The title screams that there could be a negative effect from taking vitamin D

#### The data does indeed show a  **negative effect of 0.04%**
