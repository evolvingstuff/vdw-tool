* Big concern that the advertising of Statin drugs on TV do not mention the 900 studies which show an adverse affect

* pharmaceutical companies spend nearly TWICE as much on marketing in the US as they do on research and development of new drugs,

* Between 1994 and 2000, US TV drug ads increased 40-fold.

* Ninety-Nine Out of 100 People Do Not Need Statin Drugs

[Tobacco Advertising](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_advertising#Advertisement_control)

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Actually The Philippines still permits tobacco advertisement on TV – from 7AM to noon

[Direct to Consumer advertising of drugs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-to-consumer_advertising)

Perhaps TV advertising of drugs is allowed in Australia and Canada as well - see Mercola comments
