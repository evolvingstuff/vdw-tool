#### Vitamin D Status, Receptor Gene Polymorphisms, and Supplementation on Tuberculosis:   
A Systematic Review of Case-Control Studies and Randomized Controlled Trials

### Highlights:

•Lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D increases susceptibility to tuberculosis.

•BsmI and FokI VDR gene polymorphisms may confer increased risk of acquiring tuberculosis.

•Vitamin D supplementation reduces tuberculosis incidence and increases recovery from tuberculosis.

Objective

To investigate the impacts of vitamin D status, supplementation and vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms on tuberculosis (TB).

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of published studies pertaining to case-control and randomized-control trials from 2002 to 2014 using the PubMed database.

Results and conclusion: 

Individuals with TB have lower vitamin D status than healthy individuals. Some VDR gene polymorphisms are associated with increased susceptibility to TB while others may not. Supplementation with vitamin D leads to improved clinical outcomes. However, further studies with a larger patient population and different ethnicities are needed to confirm these effects.
