#### Update - study did not find a benefit when starting at 17th week

* [Vitamin D Supplementation in Pregnancy and Lactation and Infant Growth](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30089075) Aug 2018

> 28,000 IU/week, not start until 17th week, which is too late to be a benefit

* [Ensure a healthy pregnancy and baby - take Vitamin D before conception](/tags/ensure-a-healthy-pregnancy-and-baby-take-vitamin-d-before-conception.html)

   * 10th week is the latest to start with Vitamin D maintenance dose

### Overview

Daniel Roth and colleagues at the Hospital for Sick Kids in Canada will test the role of Vitamin D in improving growth during pregnancy. 

We’ve known for a long time that Vitamin D is important for bone growth, but we know surprisingly little about its role in fetal growth.

### Parathyroid-Vitamin D Axis Dysregulation in Early-Onset Infant Stunting in Resource-Poor Primary

#### Investigator:	Daniel Roth, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada - CA

 **Challenge: Discover New Ways to Achieve Healthy Birth, Growth, and Development** 

Daniel Roth of the Hospital for Sick Kids in Canada and colleagues will test whether endocrine factors cause stunting in early infancy. 

They will analyze  **parathyroid hyperactivity**  in a cohort of infants from Bangladesh, where stunting is estimated to affect almost half of all children under the age of 5. To uncover the mechanisms responsible for this hyperactivity, they will conduct a vitamin D supplementation trial and analyze maternal, cord, and infant plasma specimens for evidence of dysregulation of the parathyroid-vitamin D axis. Their goal is to understand the cause of widespread vitamin D deficiency in the region, which is under-appreciated, and its linkage to early growth retardation.

45% of children in Bangladesh are stunted – due to malnutrition and low levels of vitamin D

#### About $100 more income during woking life for every $1 spent on nutrition to prevent stunting

focus on age 0-2 years, no mention of vitamin D
