#### Peritoneal dialysis appears to lead to low Vitamin D, anemia, inflammation, etc. - Sept 2021

 **Low serum vitamin D concentration is correlated with anemia, microinflammation, and oxidative stress in patients with peritoneal dialysis** 

J Transl Med . 2021 Sep 27;19(1):411. [doi: 10.1186/s12967-021-03077-w.](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-021-03077-w.)

Background: Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a form of dialysis to replace the function of kidney, that uses the peritoneum as a dialysis membrane to remove metabolites and water retained in the body. Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in patients treated with PD. This research investigated the correlation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentration and anemia, microinflammation, and oxidative stress in PD patients.

Methods: 62 PD patients and 56 healthy volunteers were recruited in this research. Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D and basic parameters of anemia were detected. The correlation between serum 25(OH)D concentration with anemia, oxidative stress, and microinflammatory state were analyzed.

Results: In the PD group, the concentration of 25(OH)D was lower than the healthy control (HC) group (p < 0.001). Hemoglobin, red blood cell count (RBC), and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) in the PD group was significantly lower (all p < 0.001), while high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) concentrations were significantly higher, than the HC group (all p < 0.001). In the PD group, malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration was higher than in the HC group (p < 0.001), while superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were lower (both p < 0.001). Serum 25(OH)D exhibited positive correlation with hemoglobin (r = 0.4509, p = 0.0002), RBC (r = 0.3712, p = 0.0030), TIBC (r = 0.4700, p = 0.0001), SOD (r = 0.4992, p < 0.0001) and GSH-Px (r = 0.4312, p = 0.0005), and negative correlation with hs-CRP (r = - 0.4040, p = 0.0011), TNF-α (r = - 0.4721, p = 0.0001), IL-6 (r = - 0.5378, p < 0.0001) and MDA (r = - 0.3056, p = 0.0157).

Conclusion: In conclusion, reduced serum 25(OH)D concentrations in PD patients contribute to anemia, oxidative stress and microinflammatory state.

#### Peritoneal dialysis and low Vitamin D - April 2014

 **Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentrations are more deficient/insufficient in peritoneal dialysis than haemodialysis patients in a sunny climate**

Background: Research has identified associations between serum 25(OH)D and a range of clinical outcomes in chronic kidney disease and wider populations. The present study aimed to investigate vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency in dialysis patients and the relationship with vitamin D intake and sun exposure.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was used. Participants included 30 peritoneal dialysis (PD) (43.3% male; 56.87 ± 16.16 years) and 26 haemodialysis (HD) (80.8% male; 63.58 ± 15.09 years) patients attending a department of renal medicine. Explanatory variables were usual vitamin D intake from diet/supplements (IU day−1) and sun exposure (min day−1). Vitamin D intake, sun exposure and ethnic background were assessed by questionnaire. Weight, malnutrition status and routine biochemistry were also assessed. Data were collected during usual department visits. The main outcome measure was serum 25(OH)D (nm).

Results: Prevalence of inadequate/insufficient vitamin D intake differed between dialysis modality, with 31% and 43% found to be insufficient (<50 nm) and 4% and 33% found to be deficient (<25 nm) in HD and PD patients, respectively (P < 0.001). In HD patients, there was a correlation between diet and supplemental vitamin D intake and 25(OH)D (ρ = 0.84, P < 0.001) and average sun exposure and 25(OH)D (ρ = 0.50, P < 0.02). There were no associations in PD patients. The results remained significant for vitamin D intake after multiple regression, adjusting for age, gender and sun exposure.

Conclusions: The results highlight a strong association between vitamin D intake and 25(OH)D in HD but not PD patients, with implications for replacement recommendations. The findings indicate that, even in a sunny climate, many dialysis patients are vitamin D deficient, highlighting the need for exploration of determinants and consequences.

#### [Effects of vitamin D on parathyroid hormone and clinical outcomes in peritoneal dialysis: a narrative review.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25012237?dopt=Abstract)

Vitamin D deficiency is very prevalent in dialysis and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients show lower levels of cholecalciferol (25(OH)D3) than hemodialysis patients. We conducted a systematic narrative review to assess the effects of vitamin D therapy on control of secondary hyperparathyroidism and clinical outcomes induced by vitamin D pleiotropic effects. Medline database was searched for cohort and intervention studies reporting data on vitamin D (all sterols including synthetic analogs) and peritoneal dialysis without language restriction. Two authors independently extracted data. Twenty-nine observational and eleven interventional studies were identified for inclusion (1,036 subjects). PTH levels decreased in twenty-nine studies, increased in one study and remained stable in ten studies. Thirty-three studies analyzed the oral route for vitamin D administration, ten the intraperitoneal, one the subcutaneous and one the intravenous. A significant decrease of peritonitis risk was observed in two studies. Proteinuria decreased in four studies and remained stable in one study. Peritoneal protein loss decreased in one study and was stable in two studies. Studies on the therapeutic effects of vitamin D in PD are limited and describe small population samples. Moreover, vitamin D compounds do not consistently reduce PTH levels. The administration of active vitamin D in PD may have interesting pleiotropic effects such as decreasing proteinuria and peritoneal protein loss. According to these effects, vitamin D could help to preserve residual renal function and ensure efficient peritoneal membrane dialysance.
