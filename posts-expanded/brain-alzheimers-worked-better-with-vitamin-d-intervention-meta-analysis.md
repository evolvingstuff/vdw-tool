Background: Hypovitaminosis D is associated with global cognitive impairment in adults. It remains unclear which domain-specific cognitive functions are affected with hypovitaminosis D. 

Objective. To systematically review and quantitatively synthesize the association of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations with episodic memory and executive functions in adults. 

Methods: A Medline and PsycINFO® libraries search was conducted on May 2012, with no limit of date, using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms 

* “Vitamin D” OR “Hydroxycholecalciferols” combined with the MeSH terms 

* “Memory” 

* OR “Memory Disorders” 

* OR “Executive Function” 

* OR “Attention” 

* OR “Cognition” 

* OR “Cognition disorders” 

* OR “Dementia” 

* OR “Alzheimer disease” 

* OR “Neuropsychological Tests”. 

Fixed-effects meta-analysis was performed from 12 eligible studies using an inverse-variance method. 

Results: Of the 285 selected studies, 14 observational studies (including 3 prospective cohort studies) and 3 interventional studies met the selection criteria. All were of good quality. The number of participants ranged from 44–5,692 community-dwellers (0–100% women). 

In the pooled analysis, although episodic memory disorders showed only modest association with lower 25OHD concentrations (summary effect size of the difference (ES) = −0.09 <span>[95%CI:−0.16;−0.03]</span>), 

associations of greater magnitude were found with  **executive dysfunctions**  (processing speed: 

* mean difference of Trail Making Test (TMT)-A score = 4.0 <span>[95%CI:1.20;6.83]</span>; 

* mental shifting: mean difference of TMT-B score = 12.47 <span>[95%CI:6.78;18.16]</span>; 

* information updating tests: ES = −0.31 <span>[95%CI:−0.5;−0.09]</span>). 

The pooled risk of incident decline of TMT-B score was OR = 1.25 <span>[95%CI:1.05;1.48]</span> in case of initial lower 25OHD concentrations.  **Vitamin D repletion**  resulted in improved executive functions (ES = −0.50 <span>[95%CI:−0.69;−0.32]</span> for before-and-after comparison), but exhibited no difference with control groups (ES = 0.14 <span>[95%CI:−0.04;0.32]</span> for between-group comparison after intervention). 

Conclusion: Lower serum 25OHD concentrations predict executive dysfunctions, especially on  **mental shifting, information updating and processing speed** . 

The association with episodic memory remains uncertain.
