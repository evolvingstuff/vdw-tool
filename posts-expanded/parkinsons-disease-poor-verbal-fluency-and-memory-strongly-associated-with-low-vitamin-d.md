### Memory, Mood, and Vitamin D in Persons with Parkinson's Disease.

Background: Research in recent years has suggested a role of vitamin D in the central nervous system. The final converting enzyme and the vitamin D receptor are found throughout the human brain. From animal studies vitamin D appears important in neurodevelopment, up-regulation of neurotrophic factors, stabilization of mitochondrial function, and antioxidation. 

Objective: To examine the relationship between serum vitamin D and neuropsychiatric function in persons with Parkinson's disease (PD). 

Methods: This is an add-on study to a longitudinal study following neuropsychiatric function in persons with PD. Baseline neuropsychiatric performance and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D were examined for 286 participants with PD. Measures of 

* global cognitive function (MMSE, MOCA, Mattis Dementia Scale), 

* verbal memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test), 

* fluency (animals, vegetables, and FAS words), 

* visuospatial function (Benton Line Orientation), 

* executive function (Trails Making Test and Digit-Symbol Substitution), 

* PD severity (Hoehn & Yahr and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) and 

* depression (Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)) 

were administered. Multivariate linear regression assessed the association between vitamin D concentration and neuropsychiatric function, in the entire cohort as well as the non-demented and demented subsets. 

Results: Using a multivariate model, higher vitamin D concentrations were associated with better performance on numerous neuropsychiatric tests in the non-demented subset of the cohort. Significant associations were specifically found between vitamin D concentration and  **verbal fluency**  and verbal memory ( **t = 4.31** , p < 0.001 and t = 3.04, p = 0.0083). Vitamin D concentrations also correlated with depression scores (t = -3.08, p = 0.0083) in the non-demented subset. 

Conclusions:  **Higher plasma vitamin D is associated with better cognition and better mood**  in this sample of PD patients without dementia. 

Determination of causation will require a vitamin D intervention study.
