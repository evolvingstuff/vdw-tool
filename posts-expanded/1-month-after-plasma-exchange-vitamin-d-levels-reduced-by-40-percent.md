Background: Plasma exchange is used in the treatment of diseases mediated by pathogenic circulating proteins, or for transplant desensitisation. Its non-targeted nature results in the depletion of physiologically important molecules, and it is often complicated by hypocalcaemia.

Aim: To determine the effects of plasma exchange on vitamin D binding protein and associated vitamin D metabolites.

Design: Single-centre prospective cohort study of  **11 patients** .

Methods:DBP and vitamin D metabolites were measured before and immediately after 5 plasma exchanges, and 7 and 28 days after discontinuation of plasma exchange.

Results:Plasma exchange reduced plasma 

* vitamin D binding protein concentration from 196.9 ± 53.2 to 98.5 ± 34 μg/mL (p = 0.0001), 

* 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D from 103 ± 52 pmol/l to 42 ± 4pmol/l (p = 0.003), and 

* 25-hydroxyvitamin D from 49.7 ± 29 to 22 ± 9.4 nmol/l (p = 0.0017), 

through their removal in effluent. 

 **After 7 days** , DBP and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were not significantly different from baseline, but 25-hydroxyvitamin D remained significantly lower after 

* 7 days (26.4 ± 9.8 nmol/l, p = 0.02) and 

* 28 days (30.8 ± 15.5 nmol/l, p = 0.048). 

Corrected calcium decreased from 2.23 ± 0.11 mmol/l to 1.98 ± 0.08 mmol/l(p=0.0007) immediately after 5 treatments. Plasma calcium was significantly associated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (r2 = 0.79, p < 0.0001).

Conclusions: Plasma exchange inducedan acute reversible decrease in plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, DBP, calcium, and a sustained decrease in plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D.

Effect of plasma exchange on 25-hydroxyvitamin D and DBP.

Statistical comparisons are made with baseline values for each variable. 

Plasma exchange significantly reduced DBP, although this had recovered to baseline after 7 days.

In contrast, 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations remained significantly lower than baseline after 7 and 28 days.
