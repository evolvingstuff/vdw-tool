### Vitamin D status in Chinese pregnant women and their newborns in Beijing and their relationships to birth size.

Public Health Nutr. 2013 Apr;16(4):687-92. [doi: 10.1017/S1368980012003084.](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980012003084.) Epub 2012 Jul 16.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women and their newborns in Beijing, China and the influence of vitamin D deficiency on birth size.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study.

SETTING: Data were collected from pregnant women who delivered during April to May 2010 at 306 Hospital of PLA in Beijing, China.

SUBJECTS: Participants in the study were seventy healthy nulliparous pregnant women with singleton pregnancies who delivered healthy babies at full term and their newborns.

RESULTS: Severe vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) < 25 nmol/l) was detected in 54·5 % of mothers and 46·6 % of newborns.  **Neither mothers nor newborns had serum 25(OH)D concentrations that reached the normal level (>75 nmol/l)** . The concentration of 25(OH)D in mothers was positively correlated with that in cord blood (r = 0·89, P < 0·001). 

 **Newborns of mothers with severe vitamin D deficiency had lower birth length and birth weight. The head circumference and birth weight were lower in vitamin D-deficient newborns.** 

CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that pregnant women and neonates residing in Beijing are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency. Neonatal 25(OH)D concentrations are dependently related to maternal 25(OH)D levels. Maternal and neonatal vitamin D status influences newborn size.
