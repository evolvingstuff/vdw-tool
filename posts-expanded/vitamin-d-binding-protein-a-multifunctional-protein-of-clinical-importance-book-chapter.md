Since the discovery of group-specific component and its polymorphism by Hirschfeld in 1959, research has put spotlight on this multifunctional transport protein (vitamin D binding protein, DBP). 

Besides the transport of vitamin D metabolites, DBP is a plasma glycoprotein with many important functions, including 

* sequestration of actin, 

* modulation of immune and inflammatory responses, 

* binding of fatty acids, and 

* control of bone development. 

A considerable DBP polymorphism has been described with a specific allele distribution in different geographic area. 

Multiple studies have shed light on the interesting relationship between  **polymorphisms of the DBP gene and the susceptibility to diseases** . 

In this review, we give an overview of the multifunctional character of DBP and describe the clinical importance of DBP and its polymorphisms. Finally, we discuss the possibilities to use DBP as a novel therapeutic agent.
