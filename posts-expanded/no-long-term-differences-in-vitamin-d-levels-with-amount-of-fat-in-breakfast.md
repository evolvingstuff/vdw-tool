### Meal conditions affect the absorption of supplemental vitamin D(3) but not the plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D response to supplementation.

It is sometimes assumed that dietary fat is required for vitamin D absorption, although the impact of different amounts of dietary fat on vitamin D absorption is not established. This study was conducted to determine whether the presence of a meal and the fat content of the meal influences vitamin D absorption or the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) response to supplemental vitamin D(3) . Based on earlier studies in rats we postulated that absorption would be greatest in the low-fat meal group. Sixty two healthy older men and women were randomly assigned to one of three meal groups: no meal, high-fat meal or low-fat meal; each was given a monthly 50,000 IU vitamin D(3) supplement with the test breakfast meal (or after a fast for the no-meal group) and followed for 90 days. Plasma vitamin D(3) was measured by LC/MS before and 12 hrs after the first dose; plasma 25OHD was measured by radioimmunoassay at baseline and after 30 and 90 days. 

The mean 12-hr increments in vitamin D(3) , after adjusting for age and sex, were 

* 200.9 nmol/L in the no-meal group, 

* 207.4 nmol/L in the high-fat meal group, and 

* 241.1 nmol/L in the  **low-fat meal**  group (P = 0.038), 

with the increase in the low-fat group being significantly greater than the increases in the other two groups. 

However, increments in 25OHD levels at 30 and 90 days didn't differ significantly in the three groups. 

We conclude that absorption was increased when a 50,000 IU dose of vitamin D was taken with a low-fat meal, compared with a high-fat meal and no meal, but that the greater absorption didn't result in higher plasma 25OHD levels in the low-fat meal group. © 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.
