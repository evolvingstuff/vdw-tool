### Feasibility of screening for and treating vitamin D deficiency in forensic psychiatric inpatients

Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine, Volume 19, Issue 8 , Pages 457-464, November 2012

Received 8 June 2011; received in revised form 14 February 2012; accepted 8 April 2012.

Neuroleptic and anti-epileptic medication, inadequate vitamin D intake and limited solar exposure increase the risk of vitamin D deficiency in high security psychiatric environments. Of the 33 inpatients (40% selected; 21% of hospital population) completing this cross-sectional study, 36% had insufficient and 58% deficient vitamin D. Five patients with vitamin D deficiency had secondary hyperparathyroidism, two of whom had osteopenia on dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry. At 1-year follow up, of the 31 patients eligible, 15 had accepted and continued supplements. Systematic screening is therefore necessary due to mental health and consent issues. Implications of supplementation and grounds access are discussed.

## Summary by VitaminDWiki

* Neuroleptic and anti-epileptic medication reduced vitamin D

* Limited outdoor time – like most prisoners
