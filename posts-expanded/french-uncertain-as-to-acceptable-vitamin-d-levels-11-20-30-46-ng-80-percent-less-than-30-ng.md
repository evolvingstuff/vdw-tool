#### Vitamin D "insufficiency" in adults. Beware of vague concepts with uncertain clinical relevance.

Prescrire Int. 2013 Oct;22(142):245-8. <span>[No authors listed]</span>

According to certain "reference ranges", about a billion people worldwide, including  **80% of the French population** , have vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency. In France, serum vitamin D assay has become commonplace. Between 2010 and 2011, the number of tests performed increased by about 70%, the most rapid growth in any laboratory assay. 

How are "normal" vitamin D levels and, thus, vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency, established, and what is their clinical relevance? 

To answer these questions, we reviewed the literature using the standard Prescrire methodology.

In early 2013, there is  **no international consensus**  on normal serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). 

Using biochemical criteria, some experts define normal vitamin D status as a blood 25(OH)D concentration above 30 ng/ml and vitamin D insufficiency as levels between 20 and 30 ng/ml. 

The definition of vitamin D insufficiency is disputed by other experts, who point out that 97.5% of the general population with vitamin D levels of at least 20 ng/ml have no bone disorders. 

 **Biostatistical data**  suggest that the normal range of 25(OH)D levels is between  **11 and 46 ng/ml** , but the lower limit appears to vary according to the study population. 

 **Epidemiological data**  have shown a link between 25(OH)D concentrations below  **20 ng/ml** and a variety of clinical disorders, including osteoporosis, fractures, cancer, infections, and autoimmune diseases. 

Although these data suggest a possible increase in the risk of particular disorders, they provide no information on the harm-benefit balance of vitamin D supplementation. 

A few clinical trials have shown that combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation (but not vitamin D alone) has a modest preventive effect on osteoporotic fractures in some subgroups of persons over 65 years old. Some trials showed that the calcium plus vitamin D combination was more effective than calcium alone or placebo in reducing falls among some elderly subgroups. Elderly patients were recruited for most of these trials regardless of their vitamin D status. Vitamin Dsupplementation carries a risk, albeit very small, of vitamin D overdose and hypercalcaemia. Vitamin D plus calcium supplementation increases the risk of kidney stones. In practice, when treatment with vitamin D is envisaged, there is no need to determine vitamin D status by conducting blood tests. In contrast, monitoring calcium levels can help prevent overdose.
