Got started on this when I realized that more data is not needed.

Had made the following summary in the [Overview of Breast Cancer and Vitamin D](/tags/overview-of-breast-cancer-and-vitamin-d.html)

There are over  **118 studies**  of vitamin D and the prevention/treatment of Breast Cancer

There are over  **12 meta-analysis**  of vitamin D and Breast Cancer 

- the most recent 2 both found a 2X reduction of deaths from Breast Cancer for those with sufficient vitamin D. 

There are **43 clinical trials with vitamin D intervention**  for the prevention/treatment of Breast Cancer

There is a strong indication that having lots of vitamin D would reduce chance of getting Breast Cancer by  **10X** . 

We wonder just how much more proof "Breast Cancer Institutions" will need to before they accept that vitamin D can prevent and treat Breast Cancer.

It appears that a huge global educational effort would be needed to change the behaviour of individuals

Women have been educated to, and are used to, self examins and getting periodic mammograms.  [History of mammograms](http://www.cancer.org/healthy/findcancerearly/cancerscreeningguidelines/chronological-history-of-acs-recommendations)

Mammograms might increase early detection (there is some doubt),

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For less  cost than a mammogram women can take enough vitamin D to reduce the chance of getting Breast Cancer by perhaps 10X. 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just 1 vitamin D pill a month would be enough (similar to monthly self-examine). But women are not aware of that. 

### Perhaps we should follow the money.

 **Target those groups which will become wealthier when breast cancer rates are reduced.** 

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Health Maintenance Organizations | Same income, less outgo |
| Employeers – huge | often self-insured , so reduced health costs |
| Employeers – other | less sick leave, less decrease in productivity |
| Govts which pay Medical Costs | govt will benefit from lowered medical costs, but they are limited by what doctors will do |
| Insurance companies | Less cost of treatment, might reduce premiums for those who take vitamin D |

 **Groups which do not appear to benefit from reduction in Breast Cancer** 

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Breast Cancer groups | tend to decrease in size/influence/income |
| Surgeon/Hospitals | far less business  |
| Mammogram groups | far less business |
