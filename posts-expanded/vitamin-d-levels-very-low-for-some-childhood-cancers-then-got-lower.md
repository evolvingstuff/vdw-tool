The aim of this study was to evaluate serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations in survivors of childhood cancer and compare levels by underlying diagnosis and as a function of time.

Procedure

A retrospective review of 201 pediatric cancer survivors enrolled in a hospital-based cancer survivor registry. Demographic characteristics and 25OHD levels were extracted from the registry. Vitamin D status was determined during routine clinical care and was categorized as normal, insufficient, or deficient.

Results

25OHD levels differed significantly across diagnoses (P?=?0.017), with the lowest levels found in patients treated for 

* osteosarcoma, 

* retinoblastoma, 

* hepatoblastoma, and 

* myeloid leukemias. 

Age was inversely correlated with 25OHD levels (P?=?0.03). Average 25OHD level at study entry was 29.8?ng/ml (range: 5–79.7), with 14.4% vitamin D deficient, 39.3% insufficient, and 46.3% normal. 25OHD concentrations decreased 11.4% over time (P?<?0.00001).

Conclusion

 **Fewer than half of childhood cancer survivors have normal 25OHD concentrations** , which further declined over time. 

Patients with solid tumors were the most affected, despite their lack of routine exposure to glucocorticoids. 

Future investigations should focus on why vitamin D level varies by diagnosis and how best to replete in this population.
