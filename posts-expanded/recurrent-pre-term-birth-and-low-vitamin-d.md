OBJECTIVE: To determine whether vitamin D status is associated with recurrent preterm birth, and any interactions between vitamin D levels and fish consumption.

DESIGN: A nested case-control study, using data from a randomised trial of  **omega-3 fatty acid supplementation to prevent recurrent preterm birth.** 

SETTING: Fourteen academic health centres in the USA.

POPULATION: Women with prior spontaneous preterm birth.

METHODS: In 131 cases (preterm delivery at <35 weeks of gestation) and 134 term controls, we measured serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) from samples collected at baseline (16-22 weeks of gestation). Logistic regression models controlled for study centre, maternal age, race/ethnicity, number of prior preterm deliveries, smoking status, body mass index, and treatment.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recurrent preterm birth at <37 and <32 weeks of gestation.

RESULTS: The median mid-gestation serum 25(OH)D concentration was 67 nmol/l, and 27% had concentrations of <50 nmol/l. Serum 25(OH)D concentration was not significantly associated with preterm birth (OR 1.33; 95% CI 0.48-3.70 for lowest versus highest quartiles). Likewise, comparing women with 25(OH)D concentrations of 50 nmol/l, or higher, with those with <50 nmol/l generated an odds ratio of 0.80 (95% CI 0.38-1.69). Contrary to our expectation, a negative correlation was observed between fish consumption and serum 25(OH)D concentration (-0.18, P < 0.01).

CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of women with a prior preterm birth, vitamin D status at mid-pregnancy was not associated with recurrent preterm birth.
