### Vitamin D and the breastfed infant: family physicians’ recommendations (118.5)

The FASEB Journal, vol. 28 no. 1 Supplement 118.5

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that all breastfed infants be supplemented with 400 IU of vitamin D daily, beginning soon after birth. We surveyed all Family Medicine providers at a single, academic medical institution regarding their perceptions and practices of infant vitamin D supplementation. 

Of 99 surveys solicited, 56  **(57%) responded.** 

Respondents were  **aware**  of the AAP recommendation with 52 ( **93%** ) correctly identifying the AAP’s recommended dose. 

The self-reported median (interquartile range) proportion of visits in which the provider recommended supplementation to exclusively or partially breastfed infants were 80% (50 - 97%) and 50% (25 - 80%), respectively. The most common reason (82%) for recommending supplementation was “to follow the AAP recommendations.” Thirty (54%) reported recommending vitamin D supplementation within the first two weeks of life. Of all respondents, 49 (88%) recommend infant vitamin D drops as the route of supplementation. Finally, 49 (88%) respondents would prefer to supplement the mother instead of the infant or offer the parents a choice if this were an adequate and safe option for vitamin D supplementation, and 17 (30%) would prefer monthly to daily supplementation.

In conclusion, Family Medicine providers are aware of current AAP recommendations, but vary in their practices; they are open to maternal vitamin D supplementation as an alternative option.
