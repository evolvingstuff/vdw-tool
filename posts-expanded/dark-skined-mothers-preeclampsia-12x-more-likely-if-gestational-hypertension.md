#### Vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women of ethnic minority: a potential contributor to preeclampsia

Objective: We investigated risk for comorbidities and preeclampsia at low vitamin D levels in ethnic minorities.

Study design: Umbilical cord vitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration was determined in urban minorities: 80.9% African American and 17% Hispanic mothers-baby pairs. To identify the correlation between vitamin D levels and high-risk comorbidities which result in preeclampsia, multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed.

Result: Below the Institute of Medicine threshold of 25(OH)D for pregnant women (25 ng ml−1), obesity (P=0.055) and pregestational diabetes (odds ratio (OR)=2.056) were observed. 

The study median was 16 ng ml−1 (<25th percentile), at which 

* gestational hypertension (P=0.042), 

* chronic hypertension (OR=4.842) and 

* pregestational diabetes (OR=3.45) became relevant. 

 **The risk for preeclampsia increased** 

* 12-fold with gestational hypertension (P=0.003) and 

* 14-fold with combined chronic and gestational hypertension (P=0.001).

Conclusion: Pregnant women of ethnic minority had lower median vitamin D levels which may contribute to a potential risk for preeclampsia.
