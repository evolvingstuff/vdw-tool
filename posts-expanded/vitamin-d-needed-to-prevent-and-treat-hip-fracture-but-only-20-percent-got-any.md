## Before and after hip fracture, vitamin D deficiency may not be treated sufficiently.

Our findings show that  **only about 20 % of seniors receive vitamin D supplementation**  prior to their index hip fracture or after the event. We further confirm the high prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency in this population and show that those who receive supplementation have significantly higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) status.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to assess current practice in pre- and post-hip fracture care practice with respect to vitamin D supplementation.

METHODS: We surveyed 1,090 acute hip fracture patients age 65 and older admitted to acute care for hip fracture repair; 844 had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels measured upon admission to acute care, and 362 agreed to be followed at 12 month after their hip fracture. Prevalence of vitamin D supplementation was assessed upon admission to acute care (at the time of hip fracture), upon discharge from acute care, and at 6 and 12 months follow-up.

RESULTS: Of 1,090 acute hip fracture patients (mean age 85 years, 78 % women, 59 % community-dwelling), 19 % had received  **any dose of vitamin D**  prior to the index hip fracture, 27 % (of 854 assessed) at discharge from acute care, 22 % (of 321 assessed) at 6 month, and 21 % (of 285 assessed) at 12 month after their hip fracture. 

At the time of fracture, 

* 45 % had 25(OH)D levels below 10 ng/ml,

* 81 % had levels below 20 ng/ml, and 

* 96 % had levels below 30 ng/ml. 

Notably, 25(OH)D levels did not differ by season or gender but were significantly higher among 164 hip fracture patients, with any vitamin D supplementation compared with 680 without supplementation (19.9 versus 10.8 ng/ml; p < 0.0001).

CONCLUSION: Only about 20 % of seniors receive vitamin D at the time of their fracture and after the event. This is despite the documented 81 % prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Interdisciplinary efforts may be warranted to improve vitamin D supplementation in seniors both before a hip fracture occurs and after.
