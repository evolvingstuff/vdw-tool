BACKGROUND: An inverse relationship between major depressive disorder (MDD) and bone mineral density (BMD) has been suggested, but prospective evaluation in premenopausal women is lacking.

METHODS: Participants of this prospective study were 21 to 45 year-old premenopausal women with MDD (n?=?92) and healthy controls (n?=?44). We measured BMD at the anteroposterior lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip, mid-distal radius, trochanter, and Ward's triangle, as well as serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), ionized calcium, plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), serum cortisol, and 24-hour urinary-free cortisol levels at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured at baseline.

RESULTS: At baseline, BMD tended to be lower in women with MDD compared to controls and BMD remained stable over time in both groups. 

At baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months intact PTH levels were significantly higher in women with MDD vs. controls. 

At baseline, ionized calcium and  **25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were significantly lower in women with MDD compared to controls.**  

At baseline and 12 months, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, a marker of bone formation, was significantly higher in women with MDD vs. controls. 

Plasma ACTH was also higher in women with MDD at baseline and 6 months. 

Serum osteocalcin, urinary N-telopeptide, serum cortisol, and urinary free cortisol levels were not different between the two groups throughout the study.

CONCLUSION: Women with MDD tended to have lower BMD than controls over time. 

Larger and longer studies are necessary to extend these observations with the possibility of prophylactic therapy for osteoporosis.
