## Maternal obesity and vitamin D sufficiency are associated with cord blood vitamin D insufficiency.

J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2013 Jan;98(1):114-9. [doi: 10.1210/jc.2012-2882.](https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2012-2882.) Epub 2012 Nov 8.

CONTEXT: An inverse relationship between total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH D) and increased adiposity has been established in children, adolescents, and adults. However, the relationship between neonatal adiposity and vitamin D status has not been reported. Both maternal obesity and vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy are common and are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between vitamin D levels in mothers and newborns, as influenced by maternal obesity, and evaluate these associations with neonatal adiposity.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Sixty-one maternal-neonatal pairs participated in this cross-sectional study at an academic medical center. 

Mothers had a prepregnancy body mass index that was normal or obese.

OUTCOME MEASURES: Maternal and cord blood sera were assayed for 25-OH D, and neonatal body composition was measured by air displacement plethysmography.

RESULTS: Mothers had similar and sufficient levels of 25-OH D when measured at 36-38 wk gestation, irrespective of body mass index category (normal weight, 46.05, vs. obese, 49.84 ng/ml; P = not significant). However, cord blood 25-OH D was higher in neonates of normal-weight mothers compared to neonates of obese mothers (27.45 vs. 20.81 ng/ml; P = 0.02). 

The variance in cord blood 25-OH D was explained by four factors: 

* maternal 25-OH D level, 

* the presence of maternal obesity, 

* maternal age, and 

* neonatal adiposity (r(2) = 0.66).

CONCLUSION: Obese women transfer less 25-OH D to offspring than normal-weight women, despite similar serum levels. 

Cord blood 25-OH D levels directly correlate to neonatal percentage body fat. 

These novel findings unders core the evolving relationships between maternal obesity, vitamin D nutritional status, and adiposity in the neonatal period that may influence subsequent childhood and adulthood vitamin D-dependent processes.

| Measured  | Normal  | Obese |
| Mother | 46 ng  | 50 ng |
| Cord | 27 ng | 21 ng |

 **Wonder how they found so many pregnant women with high levels of vitamin D ( average of 47 ng)** 

 **Do not recall seeing this kind of association before**
