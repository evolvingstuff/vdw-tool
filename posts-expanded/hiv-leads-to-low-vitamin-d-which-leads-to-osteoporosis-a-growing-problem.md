#### Osteoporosis in persons with HIV: a future epidemic?

J La State Med Soc. 2012 May-Jun;164(3):127-30.

Clark R.

Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, USA.

Given the aging of the American population with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the high prevalence of suboptimal 25(OH)D (vitamin D) levels, osteoporosis is likely to be a growing concern among clinicians caring for this population. HIV infection has been shown to be a strong predictor for an abnormal dual X-ray absorptionmetry testing and is potentially a risk for fractures at older ages. This paper reviews management issues for osteoporosis specific to the population with HIV, including both prevention and treatment strategies.
