### Vitamin D and VDR gene polymorphism (FokI) in epithelial ovarian cancer in Indian population.

J Ovarian Res. 2013 May 26;6(1):37.

INTRODUCTION: Vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphism, FokI, is reported to increase the risk of many cancers. Role of vitamin D and its receptor polymorphisms in ovarian cancer has not been clearly defined.

OBJECTIVE: To study the levels of serum vitamin D and occurrence of vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism (FokI) in cases of ovarian cancer.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: FokI genotyping was done by PCR-RFLP technique and vitamin D levels were estimated by chemiluminescence immunoassay.

RESULTS: Serum vitamin D levels were significantly (p < 0.03) lower in ovarian cancer cases as compared to controls. The homozygous (TT) and heterozygous (CT) genotype predispose to the development of ovarian cancer in Indian population (OR:  **2.37** , 95% CI: 1.04-5.44) as compared to the homozygous (CC) genotype. 

Vitamin D deficiency and VDR gene polymorphism (FokI) act non-synergistically (p value < 0.4).

CONCLUSION: Low blood levels of vitamin D and VDR receptor polymorphism (FokI) might be a risk factor for the development of ovarian cancer. Other novel ligands of vitamin D receptor might be responsible for the non-synergistic effect.
