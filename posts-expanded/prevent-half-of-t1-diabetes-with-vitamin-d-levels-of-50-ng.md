#### Lower prediagnostic serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration is associated with higher risk of insulin-requiring diabetes: a nested case–control study

E. D. Gorham, C. F. Garland, A. A. Burgi, S. B. Mohr and K. Zeng, et al.

Diabetologia, 2012, Volume 55, Number 12, Pages 3224-3227

Aims/hypothesis  

Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentration may increase risk of insulin-requiring diabetes.

Methods  

A nested case–control study was performed using serum collected during 2002–2008 from military service members.  **One thousand subjects subsequently developed insulin-requiring diabetes** . A healthy control was individually matched to each case on blood-draw date (±2 days), age (±3 months), length of service (±30 days) and sex. 

The median elapsed time between serum collection and first diagnosis of diabetes was 1 year (range 1 month to 10 years). Statistical analysis used matched pairs and conditional logistic regression.

Results  

ORs for insulin-requiring diabetes by quintile of serum 25(OH)D, from lowest to highest, were 3.5 (95% CI 2.0, 6.0), 2.5 (1.5, 4.2), 0.8 (0.4, 1.4), 1.1 (0.6, 2.8) and 1.0 (reference) (p trend <0.001). The quintiles (based on fifths using serum 25(OH)D concentration in the controls) of serum 25(OH)D in nmol/l, were <43 (median 28), 43–59 (median 52), 60–77 (median 70), 78–99 (median 88) and ?100 (median 128).

Conclusions/interpretation  

Individuals with lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations had higher risk of insulin-requiring diabetes than those with higher concentrations. 

 **A 3.5-fold lower risk was associated with a serum 25(OH)D concentration ?60 nmol/l.**

> for most people, 4000 IU per day of vitamin D3 will be needed to achieve the effective levels
