**Take vitamin D before/during largest meal of the day** 

 **Daily is best, but twice a month is OK** 

 **You could put all of the VItamin D to be taken for the month in a container** 

 **Near end of the month - take more than one daily so as to empty the container** 

{{< toc >}}

#### Take Vitamin D with largest meal of the day

 **It appears that Vitamin D is absorbed at all locations in the small intestine**

Apparently the stomach takes longer to release food after a big meal. 

Wonder if there is a longer transit time in the small intestine after a big meal - and thus more time to get the vitamin D.

It would seem that this would be true of other supplements/drugs as well.

#### Take Vitamin D with a diet which has the proper types of fats (Omega-3)

#### Amount of fats in the meal does not seem to matter much

#### Avoid late night vitamin D- changes your wake/sleep pattern
