### Vitamin D Status does not influence Bone Density in Africans Abstract P168:

Circulation. 2014; 129: AP168

Without regard to race, the Institute of Medicine states that to protect bone health vitamin D, measured as 25(OH)D, should be >20 ng/mL while levels of 12-19 ng/mL are inadequate and levels of <12 ng/mL are deficient. However, even when 25(OH)D levels are low, bone mineral density (BMD) is not compromised in African-Americans. The relationship of 25(OH)D levels to BMD in Africans is unknown. Therefore 78 African immigrants to the United States (77% male, median age 35y, age range 22-63y (95% CI: 36, 40)) had 25(OH)D levels and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. Distribution of 25(OH)D levels by quartile was determined (Fig. 1). The distribution of whole body BMD across quartiles of 25(OH)D was assessed (Fig. 2). Median 25(0H)D levels was 21 ng/mL (95% CI: 20, 23) with 47% having 25(OH)D<20 ng/mL and 8% having 25(OH)D <12 ng/mL. BMD did not change across quartiles of 25(OH)D (Fig. 2). Spearman correlation between BMD and 25(OH)D was r =0.1, P=0.5. As there was no relationship between vitamin D levels and BMD, low 25(OH)D levels are not a predictor of low bone density in Africans.
