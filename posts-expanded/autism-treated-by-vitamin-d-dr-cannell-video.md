Note Dr. Cannell's response to question #30 in the webinar

Accidentally 3 mothers gave 3 dropper fulls instead of 3 drops worth of vitamin D to their austistic children

Dr. Cannell did not say, but a typical standard is 2,000 IU in a drop, so the children got  **60,000 IU per day** 

There was a rapid recovery in all three cases.

Dr. Cannell speculated that the future goal for Autism might be a vitamin D level of 150 ng instead of the current 50-80 ng level
