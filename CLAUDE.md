# Permission Pattern

**Reading**: You can read any file proactively without asking when you need to understand the codebase, explore functionality, or gather information.

**Writing/Editing**: Always describe what you plan to change and get confirmation before making any modifications to files.

# Git Workflow

If I say:

FEATURE: I would like to ... (description goes here)

I would like you to:
1. check if I have uncommitted changes in git and warn me if I do.
2. if everything is checked in, create an appropriately named branch, based on the
feature description
3. interactively implement the future as you would normally do

I can then test it and we can interactively try to fix any issues.

If I say:

COMMIT

I want you to commit the changes to that branch, merge the branch into main, and delete that feature branch

If I say:

ROLLBACK

I want you to rollback all the changes made on that branch.

# Build Philosophy

FAIL FAST AND LOUD: If anything fails during build processes, it should fail as fast and as loudly as possible. No error recovery, no graceful degradation, no silent failures. The build should stop immediately with clear error messages so issues can be identified and fixed quickly.
